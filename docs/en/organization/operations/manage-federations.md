# Managing identity federations

If your company uses a unified credential management system, setting up identity federation will enable single sign-on to {{ yandex-cloud }} services with employee corporate accounts.

You can set up identity federation with any [SAML]({{ link-saml }})-enabled credential management service (identity provider).
