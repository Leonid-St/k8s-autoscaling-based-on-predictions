{% note info %}

{{ speechkit-name }} is designed for natural speech synthesis. Marking up data for speech synthesis helps set up pronunciation of separate words, phrases, and sentences. However, it is not intended for generating separate sounds and silence.

The markup in the text will serve as a cue for synthesis, not as a direct instruction.
