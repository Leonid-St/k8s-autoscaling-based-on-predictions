{% note tip %}

Make sure to reissue certificates and add them to a federation in a timely manner.

To keep track of when your certificate expires, [subscribe](../../organization/operations/subscribe-user-for-notifications.md) to notifications from the organization. Subscribed users get notifications 60, 30, and 5 days before the certificate expires and after its expiration.
