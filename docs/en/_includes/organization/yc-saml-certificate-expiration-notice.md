{% note tip %}

Track certificate expiration dates and always install a new certificate before the current one expires. Make sure to [download the re-issued {{ yandex-cloud }} SAML certificate and install](../../organization/operations/renew-yc-certificate.md) it on the IdP provider's side and in your federation well in advance.
