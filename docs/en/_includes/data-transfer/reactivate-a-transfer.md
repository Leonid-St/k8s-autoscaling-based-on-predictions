To restart a transfer, choose one of the two methods:

* [Deactivate](../../data-transfer/operations/transfer.md#deactivate) the transfer and wait for its status to change to {{ dt-status-stopped }}. Next, [reactivate](../../data-transfer/operations/transfer.md#activate) the transfer and wait for its status to change to {{ dt-status-repl }}.
* Update any [setting for the transfer](../../data-transfer/operations/transfer.md#update) or [endpoint](../../data-transfer/operations/endpoint/index.md#update).
