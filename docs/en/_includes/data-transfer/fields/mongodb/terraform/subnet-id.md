`subnet_id`: ID of the [subnet](../../../../../vpc/concepts/network.md#subnet) the cluster is in. The transfer will use this subnet to access the cluster. If the ID is not specified, the cluster must be accessible from the internet.

If the value in this field is specified for both endpoints, both subnets must be hosted in the same availability zone.
