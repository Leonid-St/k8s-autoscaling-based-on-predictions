When creating a snapshot or image in Linux, the UUID and PARTUUID of disk partitions are saved. Linux uses this data when mounting partitions, including the root one, so these IDs must be unique. For example, if you clone a boot disk and attach it to the same VM, the VM will have two partitions with identical UUIDs. As a result, the VM may boot from the root partition of the wrong disk, rather than the one you specified as the boot disk.
