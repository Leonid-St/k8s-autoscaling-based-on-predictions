- Management console {#console}

  1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), open the [folder](../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#folder) containing the [instance group](../../compute/concepts/instance-groups/index.md) you need.
  1. Select **{{ ui-key.yacloud.iam.folder.dashboard.label_compute }}**.
  1. In the left-hand panel, select ![image](../../_assets/console-icons/layers-3-diagonal.svg) **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.switch_groups }}**.
  1. Select the instance group to update.
  1. In the top-right corner, click ![image](../../_assets/console-icons/pencil.svg) **{{ ui-key.yacloud.common.edit }}**.
  1. Under **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.groups.create.section_allocation }}**, add the [availability zone](../../overview/concepts/geo-scope.md) you want to move the instance group to. 
  1. If your instance group is a [manually scaled](../../compute/concepts/instance-groups/scale.md#fixed-scale) one, under **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.groups.create.section_scale }}**, specify a group size sufficient to place instances in all the selected availability zones.

     You will be able to reset the number of instances back to the initial one after all the instances in the group are moved to the new availability zone and deleted from the previous one.
  1. If your instance group is an [autoscaling](../../compute/concepts/instance-groups/scale.md#auto-scale) one and has the `OPPORTUNISTIC` [shutdown strategy](../../compute/concepts/instance-groups/policies/deploy-policy.md#strategy), change the strategy to `PROACTIVE` in the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.groups.create.field_deploy-strategy }}** field.

     You will be able to reset the shutdown strategy back to `OPPORTUNISTIC` after all the instances in the group are moved to the new availability zone and deleted from the previous one.
  1. Click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.common.save }}**.

- CLI {#cli}

  {% include [cli-install.md](../cli-install.md) %}

  {% include [default-catalogue.md](../default-catalogue.md) %}

  1. Open the [instance group](../../compute/concepts/instance-groups/index.md) [specification](../../compute/concepts/instance-groups/specification.md) file and edit the [instance template](../../compute/concepts/instance-groups/instance-template.md):
     * Under `allocation_policy`, add a new [availability zone](../../overview/concepts/geo-scope.md).
     * Under `network_interface_specs`, add the ID of the previously created [subnet](../../vpc/concepts/network.md#subnet).
     * If your instance group is a [manually scaled](../../compute/concepts/instance-groups/scale.md#fixed-scale) one, under `scale_policy`, specify a group size sufficient to place instances in all the selected availability zones.

       You will be able to reset the number of instances back to the initial one after all the instances in the group are moved to the new availability zone and deleted from the previous one.
     * If your instance group is an [autoscaling](../../compute/concepts/instance-groups/scale.md#auto-scale) one and has the `OPPORTUNISTIC` [shutdown strategy](../../compute/concepts/instance-groups/policies/deploy-policy.md#strategy), change the strategy to `PROACTIVE` under `deploy_policy`.

       You will be able to reset the shutdown strategy back to `OPPORTUNISTIC` after all the instances in the group are moved to the new availability zone and deleted from the previous one.
  1. See the description of the CLI command for updating an instance group:

     ```bash
     yc compute instance-group update --help
     ```

  1. Get a list of all instance groups in the default [folder](../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#folder):

     ```bash
     yc compute instance-group list
     ```

     Result:

     ```text
     +----------------------+---------------------------------+--------+--------+
     |          ID          |              NAME               | STATUS |  SIZE  |
     +----------------------+---------------------------------+--------+--------+
     | cl15sjqilrei******** | first-fixed-group-with-balancer | ACTIVE |      3 |
     | cl19s7dmihgm******** | test-group                      | ACTIVE |      2 |
     +----------------------+---------------------------------+--------+--------+
     ```

  1. Update the instance group:

     ```bash
     yc compute instance-group update \
       --id <instance_group_ID> \
       --file <instance_specification_file>
     ```

     Where:
     * `--id`: Instance group ID.
     * `--file`: Path to the instance group specification file.

     Result:

     ```text
     id: cl15sjqilrei********
     ...
     allocation_policy:
     zones:
     - zone_id: <previous_availability_zone>
     - zone_id: <new_availability_zone>
     ...
     ```

- {{ TF }} {#tf}

  If you do not have {{ TF }} yet, [install it and configure the {{ yandex-cloud }} provider](../../tutorials/infrastructure-management/terraform-quickstart.md#install-terraform).
  1. Open the {{ TF }} configuration file for the [instance group](../../compute/concepts/instance-groups/index.md). Specify the new [availability zone](../../overview/concepts/geo-scope.md) under `allocation_policy` and the ID of the previously created [subnet](../../vpc/concepts/network.md#subnet) under `network_interface`.

     ```hcl
     ...
     network_interface {
       subnet_ids = [
         "<ID_of_subnet_in_previous_availability_zone>",
         "<ID_of_subnet_in_new_availability_zone>"
       ]
     }
     ...
     allocation_policy {
       zones = [
         "<previous_availability_zone>",
         "<new_availability_zone>"
       ]
     }
     ...
     ```

     Where:
     * `zones`: Availability zones to host the instance group, both the new and previous ones.
     * `subnet_ids`: IDs of subnets in the availability zones to host the instance group.

     If your instance group is a [manually scaled](../../compute/concepts/instance-groups/scale.md#fixed-scale) one, under `scale_policy`, specify a group size sufficient to place instances in all the selected availability zones.

     ```hcl
     ...
     scale_policy {
       fixed_scale {
         size = <number_of_instances_in_group>
       }
     }
     ...
     ```

     You will be able to reset the number of instances back to the initial one after all the instances in the group are moved to the new availability zone and deleted from the previous one.

     If your instance group is an [autoscaling](../../compute/concepts/instance-groups/scale.md#auto-scale) one and has the `OPPORTUNISTIC` [shutdown strategy](../../compute/concepts/instance-groups/policies/deploy-policy.md#strategy), change the strategy to `PROACTIVE`:

     ```hcl
     ...
     deploy_policy {
       strategy = "proactive" 
     }
     ...
     ```

     You will be able to reset the shutdown strategy back to `OPPORTUNISTIC` after all the instances in the group are moved to the new availability zone and deleted from the previous one.

     For more information about resource parameters in {{ TF }}, see the [relevant provider documentation]({{ tf-provider-resources-link }}/compute_instance_group).
  1. Apply the changes:

     {% include [terraform-validate-plan-apply](../../_tutorials/_tutorials_includes/terraform-validate-plan-apply.md) %}

     This will add the new availability zone for your instance group. You can check the updates using the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}) or this [CLI](../../cli/quickstart.md) command:

     ```bash
     yc compute instance-group get <instance_group_name>
     ```

- API {#api}

  Use the [update](../../compute/instancegroup/api-ref/InstanceGroup/update.md) REST API method for the [InstanceGroup](../../compute/instancegroup/api-ref/InstanceGroup/index.md) resource or the [InstanceGroupService/Update](../../compute/instancegroup/api-ref/grpc/InstanceGroup/update.md) gRPC API call.

  If your instance group is a [manually scaled](../../compute/concepts/instance-groups/scale.md#fixed-scale) one, specify a group size sufficient to place instances in all the selected availability zones. You will be able to reset the number of instances back to the initial one after all the instances in the group are moved to the new availability zone and deleted from the previous one.

  If your instance group is an [autoscaling](../../compute/concepts/instance-groups/scale.md#auto-scale) one and has the `OPPORTUNISTIC` [shutdown strategy](../../compute/concepts/instance-groups/policies/deploy-policy.md#strategy), change the strategy to `PROACTIVE`. You will be able to reset the shutdown strategy back to `OPPORTUNISTIC` after all the instances in the group are moved to the new availability zone and deleted from the previous one.

{% endlist %}

Wait until the instances appear in the new availability zone and get the `Running Actual` status.
