You can create snapshots of network [disks](../../compute/concepts/disk.md#disks_types) and drives, such as HDDs, SSDs, and non-replicated SSDs, as well as ultra high-speed network storages with three replicas (SSD).

For non-replicated SSDs and ultra high-speed network storages with three replicas (SSD), the snapshot time is not determined.

To create snapshots of local disks residing on [dedicated hosts](../../compute/concepts/dedicated-host.md), use [{{ backup-full-name }}](../../backup/). This service supports Ubuntu, CentOS, CentOS Stream, and Windows Server.
