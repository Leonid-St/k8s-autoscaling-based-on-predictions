With [{{ TF }}](https://www.terraform.io/), you can quickly create a cloud infrastructure in {{ yandex-cloud }} and manage it using configuration files. These files store the infrastructure description written in HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL). If you change the configuration files, {{ TF }} automatically detects which part of your configuration is already deployed, and what should be added or removed.
