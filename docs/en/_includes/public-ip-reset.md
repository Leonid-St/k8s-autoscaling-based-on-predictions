If a public IP address was assigned automatically, it will be released if you stop a VM. The VM will get a new public IP address the next time you start it. If you restart a VM, it retains the automatically assigned public IP address.

You can make a public IP address static. For more information, see [{#T}](../compute/operations/vm-control/vm-set-static-ip.md).

For more information about IP address pricing, see the [{#T}](../vpc/pricing.md#prices-public-ip) section of the {{ vpc-name }} documentation.
