To get a usable image, follow these tips:

1. Use vivid imagery, e.g., the following:
   * Winter forest
   * Sea sunset
   * Medieval castle
   * Futuristic car
   * Fall tree
1. Provide more details for objects, such as color, shape, location, and others.
1. Specify styles if you want to get a certain type of image. For example:
   * Aesthetic, beautiful, realistic, close-up.
   * Professional photo, 4k, high resolution, high detail.
   * Dali style, Monet style, Repin style.
   * Pixel graphics, Minecraft style, anime style.
   * Bright lighting, dim lighting, soft lighting, neon lighting.
1. Use descriptions instead of rare and complex concepts. For example, instead of using a little-known holiday name, you can write that people eat candies and stroll in the city square.
