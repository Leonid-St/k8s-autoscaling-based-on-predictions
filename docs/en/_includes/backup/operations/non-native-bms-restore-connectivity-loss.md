{% note warning %}

After you recover a {{ baremetal-name }} server from another serverâ€™s backup, network access to the target server may become impossible. This is because the network settings recovered from the backup, namely the network interface MAC addresses, were taken from the source server.

To restore the network on the target VM, update the MAC addresses in the server's network interface settings using the KVM console. You can get the current MAC addresses using the `ip a` command. For more information on setting up network interfaces in a particular OS, see the relevant OS guides.
