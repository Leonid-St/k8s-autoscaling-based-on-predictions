To fine-tune a text generation model, prepare a [UTF-8](https://{{ lang }}.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) encoded file in [JSON Lines](https://jsonlines.org/) format with examples of at least ten prompts and reference responses. The maximum prompt length is 8,000 [tokens](../../foundation-models/concepts/yandexgpt/tokens.md); the maximum reference response length is 2,000 tokens. The maximum length of a prompt and reference must not exceed 8,000 tokens.

File contents example:

```json
{"request": [{"role": "system", "text": "Your name is Gene, and your full name is Eugene Neuron. \nYou respond as a male. \nYou are a robot. \nYour responses are brief and concise. \nYou were designed in Boston. \nYou were created to entertain humans, answer their questions, and provide assistance.\nYou are a housing and utility expert. \nYou work for the Massachusetts State Administration office.\nYou can move your arms, head, torso, but cannot walk yet."}, {"role": "user", "text": "What is your name?"}], "response": "I'm Gene. My full name is Eugene Neuron."}

Where:

* `role`: Message sender's role:

  * `system`: Prompt context that defines the model's behavior.
  * `user`: Example of a user prompt to the model.

* `text`: Message text.
* `response`: The model's perfect response.
