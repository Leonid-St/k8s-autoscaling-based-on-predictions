  The minimum value is `0` (disables the setting); the maximum value is `2048`; the default value is `0`.

  For more information, see the [{{ PG }} documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-resource.html#GUC-BACKEND-FLUSH-AFTER).

  For more information, see the [{{ PG }} documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-resource.html#GUC-BGWRITER-DELAY).

- **Bgwriter flush after**{#setting-bgwriter-flush-after} {{ tag-con }} {{ tag-api }} {{ tag-tf }}

  Limits the amount of data processed by the background writer (in kilobytes). When the limit is exceeded, the DBMS instructs the OS to flush this data to disk. This parameter limits the amount of <q>dirty</q> data in the kernel page cache, thus reducing the likelihood of slowdowns when an `fsync` statement is issued at the end of a checkpoint or when the OS flushes data to the disk in the background.

  The minimum value is `0`; the maximum value is `2048`; the default value is `512`.

  For more information, see the [{{ PG }} documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-resource.html#GUC-BGWRITER-FLUSH-AFTER).

  For more information, see the [{{ PG }} documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/wal-configuration.html).

- **Checkpoint flush after**{#setting-checkpoint-flush-after} {{ tag-con }} {{ tag-api }} {{ tag-tf }}

  To improve the quality of the planner's estimates, increase the target.

  The minimum value is `1`; the maximum value is `10000`; the default value is `1000`.

  For more information, see the [{{ PG }} documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-query.html#GUC-DEFAULT-STATISTICS-TARGET).

- **Default transaction isolation**{#setting-default-transaction-isolation} {{ tag-all }}

  This setting determines the default isolation level to be used for new SQL transactions.

  Acceptable values:

  - `read committed` (`TRANSACTION_ISOLATION_READ_COMMITTED` for {{ TF }}, API, and CLI): The query only sees the rows that were committed before it started.
  - `read uncommitted` (`TRANSACTION_ISOLATION_READ_UNCOMMITTED` for {{ TF }}, API, and CLI): This isolation level's behavior in {{ PG }} is identical to `read committed`.
  - `repeatable read` (`TRANSACTION_ISOLATION_REPEATABLE_READ` for {{ TF }}, API, and CLI): All queries in the current transaction only see the rows that were committed before the first query to select or update data in this transaction.
  - `serializable` (`TRANSACTION_ISOLATION_SERIALIZABLE` for {{ TF }}, API, and CLI): The strictest isolation level out of all those mentioned above. This isolation level's behavior in {{ PG }} is identical to `repeatable read`. However, if the overlap of read and write operations of parallel serializable transactions is incompatible with their serial execution, one of the transactions is rolled back with the <q>serialization failure</q> error.

  The default value is `read committed`.

  To learn more about isolation levels, see the [{{ PG }} documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/transaction-iso.html).

  The setting applies at the {{ mpg-name }} cluster level, but it can be [overridden at the user level](../../../managed-postgresql/concepts/settings-list.md#dbms-user-settings).

- **Default with oids**{#setting-default-with-oids} {{ tag-all }}

  Adds the `OID` column containing a unique row ID. The setting has effect if the table is created:

  - Either without specifying `WITH OIDS` and `WITHOUT OIDS`.
  - Or using the `SELECT INTO` statement.

  The practice of using `OID` in user tables is considered obsolete, so enable this setting for backward compatibility reasons only.

  This setting is disabled by default (no `OID` column is added).

  For more information, see the [{{ PG }} documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/runtime-config-compatible.html#GUC-DEFAULT-WITH-OIDS).

- **Effective cache size**{#setting-effective-cache-size} {{ tag-all }}

  The minimum value is `0`; the maximum value is `1000`; the default value is `1`.

  For more information, see the [{{ PG }} documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-resource.html#GUC-EFFECTIVE-IO-CONCURRENCY).

  Allows the query planner to consider asynchronous execution of the query plan on different hosts when adding data from external sources. {{ PG }} supports this feature starting from version 14.

  This setting is on by default.

  For more information, see the [{{ PG }} documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-query.html#GUC-ENABLE-ASYNC-APPEND).

- **Enable bitmapscan**{#setting-enable-bitmapscan} {{ tag-all }}

  Allows the query planner to use the bitmap-scan plan types, even if this is not specified in the query explicitly. This access method is similar to regular access by index, but occurs in two steps:

  1. The index is scanned (Bitmap Index Scan) and a bitmap is built where the rows to be read by the query are flagged.
  1. The table is scanned (Bitmap Heap Scan). In which case:

     - The pages are read sequentially (this increases the likelihood of using the OS cache).
     - Each page is viewed only once.

  The setting is effective when repeating queries to tables.

  This setting is on by default.

  For more information, see the [{{ PG }} documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-query.html#GUC-ENABLE-BITMAPSCAN).

  This setting is on by default.

  For more information, see the [{{ PG }} documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-query.html#GUC-ENABLE-HASHAGG).

- **Enable hashjoin**{#setting-enable-hashjoin} {{ tag-all }}

  Allows the scheduler to `JOIN` tables based on row hash values, even if this is not specified in the query explicitly. This setting is effective when handling large amounts of data or when the tables are not sorted by the join columns.

  This setting is on by default.

  For more information, see the [{{ PG }} documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-query.html#GUC-ENABLE-HASHJOIN).

- **Enable incremental sort**{#setting-enable-incremental-sort} {{ tag-all }}

  This setting is on by default.

  For more information, see the [{{ PG }} documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-query.html#GUC-ENABLE-INCREMENTAL-SORT).

- **Enable mergejoin**{#setting-enable-mergejoin} {{ tag-all }}

  Allows the query planner to merge `JOIN` operations when joining tables.

  This setting is on by default.

  For more information, see the [{{ PG }} documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-query.html#GUC-ENABLE-MERGEJOIN).

- **Enable nestloop**{#setting-enable-nestloop} {{ tag-all }}

  Allows the query planner to use `JOIN` with nested cycles. When the setting is disabled, the query planner will use other methods.

  This setting is on by default.

  For more information, see the [{{ PG }} documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-query.html#GUC-ENABLE-NESTLOOP).

- **Enable parallel append**{#setting-enable-parallel-append} {{ tag-all }}

  For small queries, we recommend the standard planner that uses full scan. However, for the queries across many tables, a full scan might take more time than a suboptimal plan.

  The minimum value is `2`; the maximum value is `2147483647`; the default value is `12`.

    - `remote_write`: Transaction is committed if the WAL is written to the master disk, the quorum replica received the WAL and forwarded it to the OS to write it to the disk. If the master disk system is lost and the OS on the quorum replica fails, transaction data with this level of synchronization may be lost.
    - `remote_apply`: Transaction is committed if the WAL is written to the master disk, the quorum replica received the WAL and applied the updates from it.

    - `4` or `"SYNCHRONOUS_COMMIT_REMOTE_WRITE"`: Transaction is committed if the WAL is written to the master disk, the quorum replica received the WAL and forwarded it to the OS to write it to the disk.

    - `SYNCHRONOUS_COMMIT_OFF`: Transaction is committed even if its data is not yet in the WAL. Writes are not synchronous, and the transaction data might be lost as a result of a disk subsystem failure.
    - `SYNCHRONOUS_COMMIT_LOCAL`: Transaction is committed if the WAL is written to the master disk.
    - `SYNCHRONOUS_COMMIT_REMOTE_WRITE`: Transaction is committed if the WAL is written to the master disk, the quorum replica received the WAL and forwarded it to the OS to write it to the disk. If the master disk system is lost and the OS on the quorum replica fails, transaction data with this level of synchronization may be lost.
    - `SYNCHRONOUS_COMMIT_REMOTE_APPLY`: Transaction is committed if the WAL is written to the master disk, the quorum replica received the WAL and applied the changes from it.
