When hybrid storage is enabled, you can use the [{{ YZ }} extension](../../../managed-greenplum/operations/extensions/yezzey.md) to move part of your [AO and AOCO tables](../../../managed-greenplum/concepts/tables.md) from the cluster storage to a cold storage, and vice versa.

Cold storage is a convenient option if you need to store your table data for a long time without using it much. This will make data storage [less costly](../../../managed-greenplum/pricing/index.md#rules-storage).
