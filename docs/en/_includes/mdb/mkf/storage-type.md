When creating a cluster, you can select the following disk types for data storage:

* **Network HDDs** (`network-hdd`): Most cost-effective option for clusters that do not require high read/write performance.
* **Network SSDs** (`network-ssd`): Balanced solution. Such disks are slower than local SSD storage, but, unlike local disks, they ensure data integrity if {{ yandex-cloud }} hardware fails.
* **Non-replicated SSDs** (`network-ssd-nonreplicated`): Network disks with enhanced performance achieved by eliminating redundancy.

  The storage size can only be increased in 93Â GB increments.


* **Ultra high-speed network SSDs with three replicas** (`network-ssd-io-m3`): Network disks with the same performance characteristics as non-replicated ones. This disk type provides redundancy.

  Such disks can be increased in size only in 93 GB increments.

  Access to high-performance SSDs is available on request. Contact [support]({{ link-console-support }}) or your account manager.
  

* **Local SSDs** (`local-ssd`): Disks with the best performance.

  The size of such a storage can be increased:

  * For **Intel Cascade Lake**: Only in 100 GB increments.

  * For **Intel Ice Lake**: In {{ local-ssd-v3-step }} increments only.
