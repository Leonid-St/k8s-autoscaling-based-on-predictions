* **{{ ui-key.yacloud.mdb.forms.backup-retain-period }}**: Retention period for automatic backups, in days. If an automatic backup expires, it is deleted. The default is {{ mch-backup-retention }} days. For more information, see [Backups](../../../managed-clickhouse/concepts/backup.md#storage).

    Changing the retention period affects both new automatic backups and existing backups.

If the retention period increases to 9 days, the remaining lifetime for this backup will now be 3 days.
