[Create a {{ managed-k8s-name }} cluster](../../managed-kubernetes/operations/kubernetes-cluster/kubernetes-cluster-create.md). When creating it, specify the security groups prepared in advance.

If you intend to use your cluster within the {{ yandex-cloud }} network, there is no need to allocate a public IP address to it. To allow connections from outside the network, assign a public IP address to the cluster.
