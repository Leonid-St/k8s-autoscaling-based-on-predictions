* `{{ ui-key.yacloud.component.security-group-field.label_sg-none }}`: Allows any incoming and outgoing traffic for the load balancer. This is the least secure option.
* `{{ ui-key.yacloud.component.security-group-field.label_sg-auto }}`: When creating a load balancer, a security group will be automatically created that allows any incoming traffic on port `80` and TCP traffic for the load balancer's node status checks on port `30080`. Any outgoing traffic will be allowed for the load balancer.
* `{{ ui-key.yacloud.component.security-group-field.label_sg-from-list }}`: For more traffic management flexibility, [create](../../vpc/operations/security-group-create.md) your own security groups. You can select up to five security groups and link them to your load balancer.
