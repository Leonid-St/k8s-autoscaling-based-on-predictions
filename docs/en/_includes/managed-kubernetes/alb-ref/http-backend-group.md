# `HttpBackendGroup` resource fields


`HttpBackendGroup` enables you to combine backends that are {{ k8s }} services and that traffic is distributed to, into a group. The [{{ alb-name }} Ingress controller](../../../application-load-balancer/tools/k8s-ingress-controller/index.md)uses these resources to create [backend groups](../../../application-load-balancer/concepts/backend-group.md).

You need to add a reference to `HttpBackendGroup` to the [`Ingress` resource](../../../application-load-balancer/k8s-ref/ingress.md).

{% include [k8s-ingress-controller-backend-group-features](../../application-load-balancer/k8s-ingress-controller-backend-group-features.md) %}

`HttpBackendGroup` is a [custom resource](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/) from the `alb.yc.io` API group provided by an Ingress controller.

Where:

* `apiVersion`: `alb.yc.io/v1alpha1`
* `kind`: `HttpBackendGroup`
* `metadata` (`ObjectMeta`, required)
  
  Resource metadata.

  * `name` (`string`, required)

    Resource name. For more information about the format, please see the [{{ k8s }} documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names).
  
    You must specify this name in the `spec.rules.http.paths.backend.resource.name` field of the `Ingress` resource (see the [relevant configuration](../../../application-load-balancer/k8s-ref/ingress.md)).

    This name is not the backend group name in {{ alb-name }}.

* `spec` (`HttpBackendGroupSpec`)

  Resource specification.
  
  * `backends` (`[]HttpBackend`)
  
    List of backends in the group.
    
    * `name` (`string`, required)
    
      Backend name.
    
    * `weight` (`int64`)

      Relative backend weight. Traffic is distributed to backends in a group as a function of backend weights.

      Weights must be specified either for all backends in a group, or for none. If weights are not specified, traffic is distributed to the backends as if they had identical positive weights.

      If a non-positive weight is specified, a backend will not receive traffic.
    
    * `useHttp2` (`bool`)
    
      Enables HTTP/2 connections between the load balancer nodes and the backend endpoints.

      The default value is `false`: Establishing HTTP/1.1 connections.

    * `service` (`ServiceBackend`)

      Reference to the [{{ k8s }} service](../../../managed-kubernetes/concepts/index.md#service) expected to process requests as a backend.

      The `Service` resource this field refers to must be described in line with the [standard configuration](../../../application-load-balancer/k8s-ref/service-for-ingress.md).

      A backend must have either a service or an {{ objstorage-name }} bucket (`storageBucket`) specified but not both at the same time.

      {% include [k8s-ingress-controller-service-backend](../../application-load-balancer/k8s-ingress-controller-service-backend.md) %}
        
    * `storageBucket` (`StorageBucketBackend`)

      Reference to a [{{ objstorage-full-name }} bucket](../../../storage/concepts/bucket.md) expected to process requests as a backend. To learn more about using a bucket as a backend, see [{#T}](../../../application-load-balancer/concepts/backend-group.md#types).

      {% include [bucket-availability-note](../../../application-load-balancer/_includes_service/bucket-availability-note.md) %}

      A backend must have either a bucket or a {{ k8s }} service (`service`) specified but not both at the same time.
      
      * `name` (`string`, required)
      
        Bucket name.
        
    * `tls` (`BackendTLS`)
    
      TLS connection settings for the load balancer nodes and backend endpoints.
    
      If the field is specified, the load balancer establishes TLS connections with the backend and compares the certificates it gets with the certificate specified in the `trustedCa` field. If the field is not specified, the load balancer will make unencrypted connections to the backend.
        
      * `sni` (`string`)
      
        Domain name specified as the value for the Server Name Indication (SNI) TLS extension.
      
      * `trustedCa` (`string`)
      
        Contents of the X.509 certificate issued by a certificate authority in PEM format.

    * `healthChecks` (`[]HealthChecks`)

      Settings for custom [health checks](../../../application-load-balancer/concepts/backend-group.md#health-checks) of applications in a {{ managed-k8s-name }} cluster.

      By default, the {{ alb-name }} Ingress controller receives health check requests from the L7 load balancer on TCP port `10501` and health checks the [kube-proxy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-proxy/) pods on each cluster node. If kube-proxy is healthy, then, even if an application in a particular pod does not respond, {{ k8s }} will redirect traffic to a different pod with that application or to a different node.
      
      You can use the `healthChecks` parameters to [customize application health checks](../../../managed-kubernetes/tutorials/custom-health-checks.md).

      * `http` (`HttpBackend`)

        Sets HTTP as the protocol to use for the health check.

        * `path` (`string`)

          Path to the application's health check endpoint in the request URI, e.g. `/health`.

      * `port` (`int32`)

        Port on the cluster nodes used to check the application's availability. The same port is specified in the `NodePort` type [Service](../../../application-load-balancer/k8s-ref/service-for-ingress.md) resource, in the `spec.ports.nodePort` parameter.

        The application will be available for health checks at `http://<node_IP_address>:<port>/<path>`.

      * `healthyThreshold` (`int32`)

        Number of consecutive successful checks to consider the application endpoint healthy.

      * `unhealthyThreshold` (`int32`)

        Number of consecutive failed checks to consider the application endpoint unhealthy.

      * `timeout` (`string`)

        Response timeout in seconds. The values range from `1s` to `60s`.

      * `interval` (`string`)

        Interval between health check requests in seconds.

        The values range from `1s` to `60s`. The `interval` value must be larger than `timeout` by at least one second.

      {% include [alb-custom-hc-enabling](../../../_includes/managed-kubernetes/alb-custom-hc-enabling.md) %}

    * `loadBalancingConfig` (`LoadBalancingConfig`)

      Load balancing settings.

      * `balancerMode` (`string`)

        Mode of traffic distribution between the backend endpoints. Possible values: `ROUND_ROBIN`, `RANDOM`, `LEAST_REQUEST`, and `MAGLEV_HASH`. [Learn more about each mode](../../../application-load-balancer/concepts/backend-group.md#balancing-mode).

      * `panicThreshold` (`int64`)

        Percentage of healthy endpoints. If it falls below the specified value, the [panic mode](../../../application-load-balancer/concepts/backend-group.md#panic-mode) will be activated.

        The default value is `0`, which never activates the panic mode.

      * `localityAwareRouting` (`int64`)

        Percentage of incoming traffic the load balancer forwards to backends from its availability zone. The remaining traffic is evenly distributed between other availability zones. [More on locality-aware routing](../../../application-load-balancer/concepts/backend-group.md#locality).

        The default value is `0`.
