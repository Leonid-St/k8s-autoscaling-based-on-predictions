When installing Crossplane from {{ marketplace-name }}, a [provider](https://github.com/yandex-cloud/crossplane-provider-yc/) will also be installed in the cluster and configured to work with {{ yandex-cloud }} resources.

You can [change the provider settings](../../managed-kubernetes/operations/applications/crossplane.md#change-provider-settings), e.g., specify the default [cloud](../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#cloud) and [folder](../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#folder) to create your resources in. 
   
For more information about {{ yandex-cloud }} resources you can create with Crossplane, see [Getting information about resources](../../managed-kubernetes/operations/applications/crossplane.md#see-resources).
