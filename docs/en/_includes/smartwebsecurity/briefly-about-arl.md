ARL (Advanced Rate Limiter) is a module for controlling and limiting the load on web apps. The module allows you to set a limit on the number of HTTP requests over a certain period of time. All requests above the limit will be blocked. You can set a single limit for all traffic or configure different limits to segment requests by certain parameters. For the purposes of limits, you can count requests one by one or group them together based on specified characteristics.
