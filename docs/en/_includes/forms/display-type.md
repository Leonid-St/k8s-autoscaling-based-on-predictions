### View {#display-type}

Choose the prompt view type you prefer:

{% list tabs %}

- Tile

   The response options will be displayed as blocks arranged in multiple rows and columns.

   For example:

   ![](../../_assets/forms/tile.png =300x)

- Single row

   The response options will be arranged in a single row. The maximum number of response options per row is four.

   For example:

   ![](../../_assets/forms/row.png =300x)

- Asterisks

   The rating, i.e., the number of asterisks chosen by the respondent will be considered a response to the prompt.

   For example:

   ![](../../_assets/forms/stars.png =300x)

{% endlist %}

The **Tile** view type is set by default.


{% note info %}

The option for customizing the prompt view is available in the [new interface](../../forms/release-notes/2306.md) for [{{ forms-full-name }} business](../../forms/forms-for-org.md) users only.
