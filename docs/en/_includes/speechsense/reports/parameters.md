* **Speech statistics** (only for audio): Agent and customer speech quality criteria, e.g., speech rate, mutual interruptions, etc.
* **Tags**: Classifiers applied to conversation audio recognition results or text chat messages. {{ speechsense-name }} detects certain keywords, phrases, or intonations in a dialog, classifies the dialog, and marks it with a tag.

    {{ speechsense-name }} has preconfigured tags. These can give you a clue as to whether there was an informal greeting or goodbye, whether the agent thanked the customer for waiting, whether it was the customer's repeat call to support, etc. You can learn more about tags [here](../../../speechsense/concepts/tags.md).
