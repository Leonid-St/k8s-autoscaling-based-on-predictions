# IVR integration

Currently, {{ speechkit-full-name }} does not offer out-of-the-boxÂ IVR integration. To integrate your [IVR platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_voice_response), you can use the services provided by our partners. Their plugins support multiple PBX solutions, such as [Asterisk](https://www.asterisk.org), [Freeswitch](https://freeswitch.com), [Genesys](https://www.genesys.com/), and [Avaya](https://www.avaya.com/). Integrating {{ speechkit-name }} with your IVR server will allow you to set up an interactive voice menu for calls and reduce traffic load on your call center.

Use these solutions to integrate IVR with {{ speechkit-name }}:

1. [Unispeech plugins](https://www.unispeech.io/yandex) for {{ yandex-cloud }} to set up integration yourself. Using these plugins on your UniMRCP server, you can perform speech [recognition](../stt/) and [synthesis](../tts/) through the [Media Resource Control Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_Resource_Control_Protocol) (MRCP).

1. [VoiceAI Connect](https://voiceaiconnect.audiocodes.com/) provides an easy way to integrate {{ speechkit-name }} with your IVR platform.
