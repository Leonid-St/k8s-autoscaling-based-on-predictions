# Resource relationships in {{ mmy-name }}

The main entity used in {{ mmy-name }} is a _cluster_.

Each cluster consists of one or more _DB hosts_, which are virtual machines with DBMS servers deployed. Cluster hosts may reside in different availability zones and even different availability regions. You can learn more about {{ yandex-cloud }} availability zones in [Platform overview](../../overview/concepts/geo-scope.md).

* A multi-host cluster is natively fault-tolerant because its hosts can step in for one another as the clusterâ€™s primary replica.

* The cost of a single-host cluster is lower, but it does not guarantee fault tolerance.


VMs for cluster hosts can be hosted on:

* _Regular {{ yandex-cloud }} hosts_.

    These are physical servers for hosting cluster VMs. They are randomly selected from a pool of available hosts that meet the selected cluster configuration.

* _Dedicated {{ yandex-cloud }} hosts_.


    These are physical servers that only host your VMs. VMs on dedicated hosts have all features of regular VMs; additionally, they are physically isolated from other users' VMs.

    Dedicated hosts are selected from _dedicated host groups_ specified when creating a cluster.

    For more information, see [{#T}](../../compute/concepts/dedicated-host.md).


When creating a cluster, specify:
* _Host class_: VM template for deploying the cluster hosts. For a list of available host classes and their specs, see [Host classes](instance-types.md).

* _Environment_: Environment where the cluster will be deployed:
    * `PRODUCTION`: For stable versions of your apps.
    * `PRESTABLE`: For testing purposes. The prestable environment is similar to the production environment and likewise covered by the SLA, but it is the first to get new functionalities, improvements, and bug fixes. In the prestable environment, you can test compatibility of new versions with your application.


A cluster created in a folder can be accessed by all VMs connected to the same cloud network. For more information about networking, see the [{{ vpc-name }} documentation](../../vpc/).
