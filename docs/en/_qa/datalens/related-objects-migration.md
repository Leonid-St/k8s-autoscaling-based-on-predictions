### How does {{ datalens-short-name }} find linked objects during migration? {#related-objects-migration}

Link search depends on the selected type of [migration](../../datalens/workbooks-collections/migrations.md):

* During migration [by transfer](../../datalens/workbooks-collections/migrations.md#migration-transfer), {{ datalens-short-name }} finds linked objects recursively across all links. This enables you to start migration from any object. For example, you can do it from a dashboard. {{ datalens-short-name }} will find all linked charts, datasets, and connections. Then, it will perform a search for links for the objects it has found. Once finished, the service will prompt you to place all found objects in a [workbook](../../datalens/workbooks-collections/index.md).
* During migration [by copying](../../datalens/workbooks-collections/migrations.md#migration-copy), {{ datalens-short-name }} searches for linked objects down the [hierarchy](../../datalens/concepts/index.md#component-interrelation). You can start copying from any object. The object's original copy remains in the directory. {{ datalens-short-name }} will prompt you to put its copy and copies of all found objects in a single workbook.
