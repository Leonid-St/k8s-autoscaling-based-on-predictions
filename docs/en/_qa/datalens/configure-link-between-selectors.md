### How do I set up links between selectors? {#how-to-configure-link-between-selectors}

To set up links:

1. Go to the dashboard page.
1. At the top of the page, click **Edit**.
1. To the right of the widget to set up a [link](../../datalens/dashboard/link.md) for, click ![image](../../_assets/datalens/links.svg) and select the link type with the selector you need.

The link between selectors based on the same dataset is established automatically and does not require additional configuration.

{% note warning %}

Before creating a link, make sure that the field used by the selector as a filter is included in the dataset the chart is built from. For more information, see [{#T}](../../datalens/concepts/data-join.md).
