# Special terms for educational institutions

{{ yandex-cloud }} offers a free tier for educational institutions and scientific projects. You can learn more about this program [here](/datasphere-education-program).

The following limits apply to {{ ml-platform-name }} communities created under the Computer Science Program to Promote Education and Research:

* The use of high-performance [computing resource configurations](configurations.md) is limited.
* You cannot change the [project storage](project.md#storage) size.
* You cannot update certain project runtime parameters.
* You cannot create [clusters from {{ dataproc-name }} templates](data-processing-template.md).
* You cannot [deploy models](deploy/index.md) using nodes and aliases.

All limitations are marked with a special ![freetier-lock](../../_assets/datasphere/lock-yellow.svg) icon in the interface.

If you need to switch to the full version of {{ ml-platform-name }}, you can do so without recreating the community. In which case all your resources, projects, and computations will be preserved and the free tier limitations removed. To switch to the full version, contact your educational institution supervisor or the [support team]({{ link-console-support }}).
