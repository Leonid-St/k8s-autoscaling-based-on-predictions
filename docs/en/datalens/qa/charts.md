### Why do I get null output when creating a multi-dataset chart? {#null-in-multidataset-chart}

Possible causes:

* The `null` value is saved in the database table.
* When joining tables, you get the `null` values if one of the tables is lacking the entries that match the other table's entries according to the joining condition.

If values other than `null` must be displayed for each dataset:

* Make sure you have selected the correct fields when setting up links between datasets.
* Make sure there are no filters in place in the chart or dataset that could limit the resulting selection to data from a single dataset. Remove the filters and check how entries are displayed.
* Check the conditions that are limiting the selection (if an SQL query is used to build the dataset).
* Check alignment between entries from different datasets. Do it by selecting an entry from one dataset and finding a matching entry in the other dataset according to the joining condition. Make sure that values other than `null` are displayed in each dataset in the fields used to build your [multi-dataset chart](../../datalens/operations/chart/create-multidataset-chart.md).
