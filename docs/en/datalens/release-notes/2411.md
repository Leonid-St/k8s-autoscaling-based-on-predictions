Fixed getting a list of field values for a specific set of dashboard filters.

### Extra indent when enabling selector tooltip {#selector-hint}

Fixed the issue causing an extra indent in the selector's widget when enabling a tooltip in the `Checkbox` type selector.

### Inconsistent display of multi-dataset chart with parameters {#multidataset-chart}

Fixed inconsistent display of [multi-dataset chart](../concepts/chart/multidataset-chart.md) with parameters.

### QL chart creation page title {#ql-chart-create-title}

Fixed the title translation on the [QL chart creation](../operations/chart/create-sql-chart.md#main-page) page for the Russian version.

### Pivot table fixes {#pivot-table-fixes}

Fixed the following [pivot tables](../visualization-ref/pivot-table-chart.md) issues:

* Horizontal scrolling position remained the same after editing the number of elements in the pivot table with locked areas using the dashboard selector.
* Text overlap when scrolling the pivot table after pining columns with subtotals.

### Changes in tables {#table-fixes}

In [tables](../visualization-ref/table-chart.md):

* Added the [table size setting](../visualization-ref/table-chart.md#table-size-settings).
* Row measures are now displayed in the [totals](../visualization-ref/table-chart.md#add-totals) row.

The maximum **Point size** value is increased from `20` to `40` in the [scatter chart](../visualization-ref/scatter-chart.md) settings.

### Previous values in place of null values for stacked chart {#null-on-previous} 

Added the **Use previous** [setting](../concepts/chart/settings.md#section-settings) on the Y axis for the [stacked chart](../visualization-ref/area-chart.md). When enabled, it replaces the chart's empty values with the previous axis point value.

### Configuring exporting data for private embedding {#private-embed-data-export}

Added the **Allow export of data** setting for [private embedding](../security/private-embedded-objects.md#how-to-private-embed), which enables export of chart data in these formats: XSLX, CSV, and Markown.

Now, if there are selectors with restricted parameters on the dashboard, these will be unavailable in a private embedding.
