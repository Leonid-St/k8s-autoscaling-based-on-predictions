# Providing secure access to content in {{ cdn-name }} through {{ TF }}

To configure secure access to content in {{ cdn-name }}:

1. [Prepare your cloud](#before-you-begin).
1. [Delegate your domain to {{ dns-name }}](#delegate-domain).
1. [Create an infrastructure](#deploy).
1. [Publish the webiste on the web server](#publish-website).
1. [Test secure access to files](#check).

If you no longer need the resources you created, [delete them](#clear-out).


## Prepare your cloud {#before-you-begin}

{% include [before-you-begin](../../_tutorials/_tutorials_includes/before-you-begin.md) %}


### Required paid resources {#paid-resources}

{% include [paid-resources](../_tutorials_includes/protected-access-to-content/paid-resources.md) %}


## Delegate your domain to {{ dns-name }} {#delegate-domain}

{% include [delegate-domain](../_tutorials_includes/protected-access-to-content/delegate-domain.md) %}


## Create an infrastructure {#deploy}

{% include [terraform-definition](../_tutorials_includes/terraform-definition.md) %}

To create an infrastructure using {{ TF }}:

1. [Install {{ TF }}](../../tutorials/infrastructure-management/terraform-quickstart.md#install-terraform), [get the authentication credentials](../../tutorials/infrastructure-management/terraform-quickstart.md#get-credentials), and specify the source for installing the {{ yandex-cloud }} provider (see [{#T}](../../tutorials/infrastructure-management/terraform-quickstart.md#configure-provider), step 1).
1. Prepare files with the infrastructure description:

    {% list tabs group=infrastructure_description %}

    - Ready-made configuration {#ready}

      1. Clone the repository with configuration files.

          ```bash
          git clone https://github.com/yandex-cloud-examples/yc-cdn-protected-access
          ```

      1. Go to the directory with the repository. Make sure it contains the following files:

          * `yc-cdn-secure-token.tf`: New infrastructure configuration.
          * `yc-cdn-secure-token.auto.tfvars`: User data file.

    - Manually {#manual}

      1. Prepare files for uploading to the bucket:

          {% include [prepare-files](../_tutorials_includes/protected-access-to-content/prepare-files.md) %}

      1. Create a folder for configuration files.
      1. In the folder, create:

          1. `yc-cdn-secure-token.tf` configuration file

              {% cut "yc-cdn-secure-token.tf" %}

              {% include [config](../_tutorials_includes/protected-access-to-content/config.md) %}

              {% endcut %}

          1. The `yc-cdn-secure-token.auto.tfvars` user data file:

              {% cut "yc-cdn-secure-token.auto.tfvars" %}

              ```hcl
              folder_id         = "<folder_ID>"
              ssh_key_path      = "<path_to_public_SSH_key_file>"
              index_file_path   = "<name_of_website_homepage_file>"
              content_file_path = "<name_of_file_with_content_to_upload_to_bucket>"
              domain_name       = "<domain_name>"
              subdomain_name    = "<CDN_resource_subdomain_prefix>"
              bucket_name       = "<bucket_name>"
              cdn_cname         = "<CDN_provider_domain_name_value>"
              secure_key        = "<secret_key>"
              ```

              {% endcut %}

    {% endlist %}

1. Create resources:

    {% include [terraform-validate-plan-apply](../_tutorials_includes/terraform-validate-plan-apply.md) %}

{% include [after-changes-tip](../../_includes/cdn/after-changes-tip.md) %}

{% include [content-through-signed-links](../_tutorials_includes/protected-access-to-content/content-through-signed-links.md) %}


## Publish the webiste on the web server {#publish-website}

{% include [publish-website](../_tutorials_includes/protected-access-to-content/publish-website.md) %}


## Test secure access to files {#check}

{% include [check](../_tutorials_includes/protected-access-to-content/check.md) %}


## How to delete the resources you created {#clear-out}

To stop paying for the resources you created:

1. Open the `yc-cdn-secure-token.tf` configuration file and delete the description of the new infrastructure from it.
1. Apply the changes:

    {% include [terraform-validate-plan-apply](../_tutorials_includes/terraform-validate-plan-apply.md) %}
