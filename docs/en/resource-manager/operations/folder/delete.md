# Deleting a folder

To delete a [folder](../../concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#folder), you must have the [{{ roles-resource-manager-editor }}](../../security/index.md#resource-manager-editor) role or higher for that folder. If you cannot perform this operation, contact an [administrator](../../../iam/roles-reference.md#admin) or the [folder owner](../../concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#owner).

{% list tabs group=instructions %}

- Management console {#console}

  1. On the management console [home page]({{ link-console-cloud }}), select the folder. This page displays folders for the selected cloud. You can [switch to another cloud](../cloud/switch-cloud.md), if required.
  1. Click ![image](../../../_assets/console-icons/ellipsis.svg) next to the folder and select **{{ ui-key.yacloud.common.delete }}**.
  1. Select a folder deletion delay: a time period after which the folder will be deleted. Select one of the suggested periods or `{{ ui-key.yacloud_billing.component.iam-delete-folder-or-cloud-dialog.label_delete-now }}`. The default folder deletion delay is 7 days.
  1. Click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.common.delete }}**.

- CLI {#cli}

  {% include [cli-install](../../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

  1. View a description of the folder delete command:

      ```bash
      yc resource-manager folder delete --help
      ```

  1. {% include [get-folder-id-or-name](../../../_includes/resource-manager/get-folder-id-or-name.md) %}

  1. Delete the folder by specifying its name or ID:

      ```bash
      yc resource-manager folder delete <folder_name_or_ID> \
        --delete-after <folder_deletion_delay> \
        --async
      ```

      Where:

      * `--delete-after`: Folder deletion delay in `HhMmSs` format. Folder deletion process will start after the specified delay. For example, `--delete-after 22h30m50s`.

          Specify `0s` to delete the folder now.
      * `--async`: Asynchronous deletion flag.
      
          Deleting a folder can take up to 72 hours. Run the command in asynchronous mode to return to terminal management without waiting for the command to complete.

      Result:

      ```text
      id: b1gqkbbj04d9********
      description: Delete folder
      created_at: "2024-10-17T05:16:30.648219069Z"
      created_by: ajei280a73vc********
      modified_at: "2024-10-17T05:16:30.648219069Z"
      metadata:
        '@type': type.googleapis.com/yandex.cloud.resourcemanager.v1.DeleteFolderMetadata
        folder_id: b1g66mft1vop********
        delete_after: "2024-10-18T03:47:19.441433Z"
      ```

      Where `id` is the operation ID you can use to track the operation status later.

  1. (Optional) Get information about the deletion operation status:

      ```bash
      yc operation get <operation_ID>
      ```

      Once the folder deletion is over, the output will contain the `done` field set to `true` (`done: true`).

  For more information about the `yc resource-manager folder delete` command, see the [CLI reference](../../../cli/cli-ref/resource-manager/cli-ref/folder/delete.md).

- {{ TF }} {#tf}

  {% include [terraform-install](../../../_includes/terraform-install.md) %}

  To delete a folder created with {{ TF }}:

  1. Open the {{ TF }} configuration file and delete the fragment describing the folder.

      {% cut "Example folder description in a {{ TF }} configuration" %}

      ```hcl
      ...
      resource "yandex_resourcemanager_folder" "folder1" {
        cloud_id    = "b1gia12lt1tp********"
        name        = "new-folder"
        description = "this is my default-folder"
      }
      ...
      ```

      {% endcut %}

      For more information about the `yandex_resourcemanager_folder` resource parameters in {{ TF }}, see the [relevant provider documentation]({{ tf-provider-resources-link }}/resourcemanager_folder).

  1. In the command line, go to the folder with the {{ TF }} configuration file.

  1. Check the configuration using this command:

      ```
      terraform validate
      ```

      If the configuration is correct, you will get this message:

      ```
      Success! The configuration is valid.
      ```

  1. Run this command:

      ```
      terraform plan
      ```

      The terminal will display a list of resources with parameters. No changes will be made at this step. If the configuration contains any errors, {{ TF }} will point them out.

  1. Apply the configuration changes:

      ```
      terraform apply
      ```

  1. Confirm the changes: type `yes` into the terminal and press **Enter**.

      You can check the folder deletion using the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}) or this [CLI](../../../cli/quickstart.md) command:

      ```
      yc resource-manager folder list
      ```

- API {#api}

  To delete a folder, use the [delete](../../api-ref/Folder/delete.md) REST API method for the [Folder](../../api-ref/Folder/index.md) resource or the [FolderService/Delete](../../api-ref/grpc/Folder/delete.md) gRPC API call.

{% endlist %}

The resources will be stopped, and the folder status will change to `PENDING_DELETION`. You can cancel the deletion of a folder that is `PENDING_DELETION`. To do this, click the ![***](../../../_assets/console-icons/ellipsis.svg) icon to the right of the folder name in the [management console]({{ link-console-cloud }}) and select **{{ ui-key.yacloud.iam.cloud.folders.button_cancel-deletion }}**.

{% note alert %}

While a folder is `PENDING_DELETION`, your disks, reserved IPs, and other data are still stored and billed. 

While a folder is `PENDING_DELETION`, you are still charged for paid resources if metrics detect their consumption.

The cost of such storage is charged at the previous rate. Track your resource costs in [{{ billing-name }}]({{ link-console-billing }}).

{% endnote %}

Once the waiting timeout expires, the folder status will change to `DELETING`. This status means it is being permanently deleted, which can take up to 72 hours. All the folder's resources will be deleted together with it.

Sometimes, the system may cancel the deletion of a folder if it contains resources that cannot be deleted. For more information, see [{#T}](../../concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#inability-to-delete). Once the deletion is canceled, the folder will regain its `ACTIVE` status, and the user will get a message stating why the folder could not be deleted.
