# Stopping and starting an {{ OS }} cluster

You can stop and restart an {{ OS }} cluster as needed. When stopped, a cluster retains all its data. The data will be available again as soon as you restart the cluster.


You are not charged for the time when your cluster is stopped; however, you still have to pay for the storage size based on the [pricing policy](../pricing.md).

## Stopping a cluster {#stop}

{% list tabs group=instructions %}

- Management console {#console}

    1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), go to the folder page and select **{{ ui-key.yacloud.iam.folder.dashboard.label_managed-opensearch }}**.
    1. Find the cluster in the list, click the ![options](../../_assets/console-icons/ellipsis.svg) icon, and select **{{ ui-key.yacloud.mdb.clusters.button_action-stop }}**.
    1. In the dialog box that opens, confirm that you want to stop the cluster and click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.mdb.cluster.stop-dialog.popup-confirm_button }}**.

- REST API {#api}

    1. [Get an IAM token for API authentication](../api-ref/authentication.md) and put it into the environment variable:

        {% include [api-auth-token](../../_includes/mdb/api-auth-token.md) %}

    1. Use the [Cluster.Stop](../api-ref/Cluster/stop.md) method and make a request, e.g., via {{ api-examples.rest.tool }}:

        ```bash
        curl \
            --request GET \
            --header "Authorization: Bearer $IAM_TOKEN" \
            --url 'https://{{ api-host-mdb }}/managed-opensearch/v1/clusters/<cluster_ID>:stop'
        ```

        You can get the cluster ID with a [list of clusters in the folder](cluster-list.md#list-clusters).

    1. View the [server response](../api-ref/Cluster/stop.md#yandex.cloud.operation.Operation) to make sure the request was successful.

- gRPC API {#grpc-api}

    1. [Get an IAM token for API authentication](../api-ref/authentication.md) and put it into the environment variable:

        {% include [api-auth-token](../../_includes/mdb/api-auth-token.md) %}

    1. {% include [grpc-api-setup-repo](../../_includes/mdb/grpc-api-setup-repo.md) %}
    1. Use the [ClusterService.Stop](../api-ref/grpc/Cluster/stop.md) call and make a request, e.g., via {{ api-examples.grpc.tool }}:

        ```bash
        grpcurl \
            -format json \
            -import-path ~/cloudapi/ \
            -import-path ~/cloudapi/third_party/googleapis/ \
            -proto ~/cloudapi/yandex/cloud/mdb/opensearch/v1/cluster_service.proto \
            -rpc-header "Authorization: Bearer $IAM_TOKEN" \
            -d '{
                  "cluster_id": "<cluster_ID>"
                }' \
            {{ api-host-mdb }}:{{ port-https }} \
            yandex.cloud.mdb.opensearch.v1.ClusterService.Stop
        ```

        You can get the cluster ID with a [list of clusters in the folder](cluster-list.md#list-clusters).

    1. View the [server response](../api-ref/grpc/Cluster/stop.md#yandex.cloud.operation.Operation) to make sure the request was successful.
