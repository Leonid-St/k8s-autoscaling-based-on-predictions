# {{ translate-full-name }} overview

You can use {{ translate-name }} to integrate [Yandex Translate](https://translate.yandex.ru) algorithms into custom applications or web projects. With support for over 100 languages, {{ translate-full-name }} can translate individual words and whole texts.

## Language detection {#detect}

If you do not know the source language of a text, {{ translate-full-name }} will automatically detect it while translating. You can also use it only to [detect the text language](../operations/detect.md).

## Glossaries {#glossaries}

To increase the accuracy of translations on a specific topic, you can [provide a glossary in your request](../operations/better-quality.md#with-glossary). A glossary is a termbase containing words and phrases with a single translation. You can learn more about glossaries [here](glossary.md).
