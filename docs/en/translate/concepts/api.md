# {{ translate-full-name }} API

You can use the {{ translate-name }} API for machine translation of text. To learn how to use the API, see our [guides](../operations/index.md).

The {{ translate-name }} API is based on the gRPC mechanism. API methods and data structures are described using Protocol Buffers (proto 3).

The {{ translate-name }} API does not support a resource-based approach, since it does not use {{ yandex-cloud }} resources. {{ translate-name }} API requests are not idempotent.
