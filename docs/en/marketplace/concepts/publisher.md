# Partner profile

A partner profile is a single center you can manage your products from. It is created when you register your organization and serves as a container for all the [products](./product.md) you publish in {{ marketplace-full-name }}.

To allow your organization's other [users](../../organization/concepts/membership.md) to manage your products, [grant](../security/partners.md#assign-role) them access to the partner profile.

You can also grant other users access to the [service accounts](../../iam/concepts/users/service-accounts.md) you are going to use to interface with the {{ marketplace-short-name }} API.
