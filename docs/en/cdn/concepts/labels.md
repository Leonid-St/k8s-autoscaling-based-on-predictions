# Labels

A _label_ is a key-value pair used for logical CDN resource labeling.

## CDN resource labels {#cdn-resources-labels}

CDN resources support [labels](../../resource-manager/concepts/labels.md) {{ resmgr-full-name }}.


You can view spending details for CDN resources or other resources of {{ yandex-cloud }} [services](../../resource-manager/concepts/labels.md#services) marked with a particular label. For example, using labels, you can view expenses for a particular project or organizational department.

You can view expenses by labeled resources in a CSV [file with usage details](../../billing/operations/get-folder-report.md#format) and on the [{{ datalens-full-name }}](../../billing/operations/dashboard.md) dashboard.
