title: Access management in {{ container-registry-full-name }}
description: Access management in {{ container-registry-full-name }}, a service for Docker image storage and distribution. This section describes the resources for which you can assign a role, the roles existing in the service, and the roles required to perform a particular action.

# Access management in {{ container-registry-name }}

In this section, you will learn:
* [Which resources you can assign a role for](#resources).
* [Which roles exist in the service](#roles-list).
* [Which roles are required](#choosing-roles) for particular actions.

{% include [about-access-management](../../_includes/iam/about-access-management.md) %}

Roles for a resource can be assigned by users who have the `container-registry.admin` role or one of the following roles for that resource:

{% include [roles-list](../../_includes/iam/roles-list.md) %}

## Which resources you can assign a role for {#resources}

{% include [basic-resources](../../_includes/iam/basic-resources-for-access-control.md) %}

You can also assign roles for individual resources within the service:

{% list tabs group=instructions %}

- Management console {#console}

  You can use the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}) to assign roles for a [registry](../concepts/registry.md).

- CLI {#cli}

  You can use the [{{ yandex-cloud }} CLI](../../cli/cli-ref/container/cli-ref/index.md) to assign roles for the following resources:

  * [Registry](../concepts/registry.md)
  * [Repository](../concepts/repository.md)

- {{ TF }} {#tf}

  You can use [{{ TF }}]({{ tf-provider-link }}) to assign roles for the following resources:

  * [Registry](../concepts/registry.md)
  * [Repository](../concepts/repository.md)

- API {#api}

  You can use [{{ yandex-cloud }}](../api-ref/authentication.md) API to assign roles for the following resources:

  * [Registry](../concepts/registry.md)
  * [Repository](../concepts/repository.md)

{% endlist %}

## What roles do I need {#choosing-roles}

The table below lists the roles required to perform a particular action. You can always assign a role offering more permissions than the one specified. For example, you can assign the `editor` role instead of `viewer`.

Action | Methods | Required roles
