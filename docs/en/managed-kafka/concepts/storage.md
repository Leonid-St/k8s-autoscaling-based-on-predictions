# Storage in {{ mkf-name }}


{{ mkf-name }} allows you to use network and local storage drives for database clusters. Network drives are based on network blocks, which are virtual disks in the {{ yandex-cloud }} infrastructure. Local disks are physically located on [broker servers](brokers.md).

{% include [storage-type-nrd](../../_includes/mdb/mkf/storage-type.md) %}

## Selecting the disk type during cluster creation {#storage-type-selection}


The number of broker hosts you can create together with an {{ KF }} cluster depends on the selected disk type:

* You can create a cluster of only three or more broker hosts using the following disk types:

    * Local SSDs (`local-ssd`)
    * Non-replicated SSDs (`network-ssd-nonreplicated`)

    This cluster will be fault-tolerant only if all the [conditions](index.md#fault-tolerance) are met.

* You can add any number of broker hosts within the current quota when using the following disk types:

    * Network HDDs (`network-hdd`)
    * Network SSDs (`network-ssd`)    * Ultra high-speed network SSDs with three replicas (`network-ssd-io-m3`)

For more information about limits on the number of broker hosts per cluster, see [Quotas and limits](./limits.md).


## Minimum storage size {#minimal-storage-size}

In order to work, each [topic](topics.md#topics) requires space in broker host storage. The amount of such space depends on the replication factor and the number of [partitions](topics.md#partitions). If there is not enough available storage space, you will not be able to create a new topic.

{% note tip %}

You can always [increase](../operations/storage-space.md#change-disk-size) the storage size up to the current [quota]({{ link-console-quotas }}).

{% endnote %}

You can calculate the minimum storage size for all topics using the formula below:

`2 × maximum log segment size × number of partitions in cluster × replication factor`.

If topic partitions are evenly distributed, divide the value calculated with this formula by the number of broker hosts.

## Maximum log segment size {#maximum-log-segment-size}

At least two log segments are required for each replica of a topic partition. You can set the maximum size of such a segment:
* [At the topic level](../operations/cluster-topics.md#update-topic) using the [Segment bytes](settings-list.md#settings-topic-segment-bytes) setting.
* Globally at the [cluster level](../operations/cluster-update.md#change-kafka-settings) using the [Log segment bytes](settings-list.md#settings-log-segment-bytes) setting.

Thus, the minimum storage size for all topics is: `2 × maximum log segment size × number of partitions in cluster × replication factor`. If the cluster partitions are evenly distributed, you can divide the resulting value by the number of brokers to determine the required storage size per broker.

By default, the segment size is 1 GB.

## Disk space management {#manage-storage-space}

As soon as {{ KF }} logs take up 97% of storage capacity, the host automatically enters read-only mode. The {{ mkf-name }} cluster blocks requests to write to the topic.


You can monitor storage utilization on cluster hosts [by setting up alerts in {{ monitoring-full-name }}](../operations/storage-space.md#set-alert):


### Recovering a cluster from read-only mode {#read-only-solutions}

Use one of these methods:

* [Increase the storage capacity](../operations/storage-space.md#change-disk-size) to exceed the threshold value. The {{ mkf-name }} cluster will then automatically clear read-only mode.
* [Set up](../operations/storage-space.md#disk-size-autoscale) automatic increase of storage size.

### Automatic increase of storage size {#auto-rescale}

Automatic increase of storage size prevents situations where the disk runs out of free space and the host switches to read-only mode. The storage size increases upon reaching the specified threshold percentage of the total capacity. There are two thresholds:

* Scheduled increase threshold: When reached, the storage size increases during the next [maintenance window](maintenance.md#maintenance-window).
* Immediate increase threshold: When reached, the storage size increases immediately.

You can use either one or both thresholds. If you set both, make sure the immediate increase threshold is higher than the scheduled one.

{% include [storage-resize-steps](../../_includes/mdb/mkf/storage-resize-steps.md) %}

You can configure automatic increase of storage size when [creating](../operations/cluster-create.md) or [updating a cluster](../operations/storage-space.md#disk-size-autoscale). If you set the scheduled increase threshold, you also need to configure the maintenance window schedule.
