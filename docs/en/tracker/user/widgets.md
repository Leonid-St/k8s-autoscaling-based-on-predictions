# Widgets

Widgets are small cards with useful information. The widget content is generated automatically. The list of issues that a widget is based on is set using [filters](create-filter.md). The following widgets are available in {{ tracker-name }}:

* [{#T}](./tasks.md)
* [{#T}](./note.md)
* [{#T}](./summary-table.md)
* [{#T}](./summary-table-with-totals.md)
* [{#T}](./events.md)
* [{#T}](./issues-stat.md)
* [{#T}](./created-and-resolved.md)
* [{#T}](./cycle-time.md)

You can find sample widgets for your support team in [{#T}](../support-process-dashboards.md).
