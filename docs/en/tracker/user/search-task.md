# Finding issues by key or name

If you know the name of an issue or its key, you can search for it using the search bar or query language.


* Use the search bar.

   In the left-hand panel, open ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/tasks.svg) **Issues** and enter your search query in the **Search by issue name** field.

* Use the [query language](query-filter.md).

   Open the [**Issues** page]({{ link-tracker }}issues) and click ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/query-language.svg) **Query language** in the top-right corner.

   Enter your query in the query string. Use the following parameters in the query:

   * `Key`: to search for an issue by the exact key value.
   * `Summary`: to search for an issue by [name](query-filter.md#query-text).
