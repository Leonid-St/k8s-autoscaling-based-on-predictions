# Issues

![](../../_assets/tracker/widgets/filter.png)

This widget enables you to view a list of issues that match a certain filter. With such widgets, you can use the same page to view your issue from a specific queue or your current issues.

To configure a widget, set the following:

- **Widget name**: Name to display in the widget header.
- **Number of issues per page**: Number of issues that are shown per widget page. If there are more issues, you can use page navigation at the bottom of the widget.
- **Issue source**: Filter on the basis of which the list of issues is formed. You can select a [system](default-filters.md) filter or a [previously created](create-filter.md) filter from the list or specify a filter using the [query language](query-filter.md) or parameters.
- **Columns**: Issue fields to show in the list. You can add multiple fields. To delete a field, click **x**.
