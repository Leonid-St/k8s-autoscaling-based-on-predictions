# Created/Resolved chart

![](../../_assets/tracker/widgets/create-resolve.png)

The chart enables you to compare the number of created andÂ closed issues. You can specify the period and step for collecting statistics.

To configure a widget, set the following:

- **Widget name**: Name to display in the widget header.

- **Issue source**: Filter on the basis of which the list of issues is formed. You can select a [system](default-filters.md) filter or a [previously created](create-filter.md) filter from the list or specify a filter using the [query language](query-filter.md) or parameters.

- **Group**: Select the step and specify the period for collecting statistics.

- **Show average value**: If this option is enabled, a trend line is displayed under the chart.

- **Show cumulative total**: If this option is enabled, data collected from previous steps is included in each subsequent step.

- **Show versions**: If this option is enabled, the chart shows the versions that issues belong to.
