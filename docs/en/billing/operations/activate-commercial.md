# Activate the paid version

You need to activate the paid version within sixty days after the trial period expires. Otherwise, all of your resources are deleted automatically.

{% include [trial-period](../../_includes/trial-period.md) %}

If you have not spent the full amount of the [initial grant](../concepts/bonus-account.md) during the trial period, you can use its balance to pay for the resources you will consume in the future.

To upgrade to the paid version:

{% list tabs group=instructions %}

- {{ billing-interface }} {#billing}

   1. {% include [move-to-billing-step](../_includes/move-to-billing-step.md) %}
   1. Select a billing account.
   1. On the ![image](../../_assets/console-icons/flag.svg) **{{ ui-key.yacloud_billing.billing.account.switch_overview }}** page, click **{{ ui-key.yacloud_billing.billing.account.button_billing-payment-action }}**.
   1. Confirm the action by clicking **{{ ui-key.yacloud_billing.billing.account.button_billing-payment-action }}** again.

{% endlist %}


Upon activation of the paid version, your [personal account balance](../concepts/personal-account.md#balance) will be zero by default. We recommend monitoring and [topping up](../operations/pay-the-bill.md) your account so it is always positive.
<br/>If you fail to top up your account on time and run into arrears, your use of {{ yandex-cloud }} services may be suspended. For more information, see [Billing cycle for organizations and individual entrepreneurs](../payment/billing-cycle-business.md).
