# Payment invoice

A payment invoice is a document issued for you to pay for the resources consumed. A payment invoice is issued in your [billing account](billing-account.md) and contains aggregate data on all the services used within a single cloud.


The relationship between the payment invoice, billing account, and cloud is shown in the diagram below.

## Issuing a payment invoice {#agregate}

A payment invoice is generated automatically and issued at the beginning of the following reporting period under the conditions below:
* The selected payment method is [Transfer from bank account](../payment/payment-methods-business.md).
* [Total invoice amount](#payment-amount) is greater than zero.

Payment invoices are sent only to the email address of the user who created the [billing account](billing-account.md). You cannot change the email address, but you can configure message forwarding. For more information, see [Yandex Mail Help](https://yandex.com/support/mail/web/preferences/filters/forwarding.html).

{% note info %}

{{ yandex-cloud }} reserves the right to issue a payment invoice during the current reporting period if your [personal account](personal-account.md) is in arrears.

Customers qualifying as a business and not using a linked corporate bank card to top up their account must [generate a payment invoice](../operations/pay-the-bill.md#legal-entities) via the management console by themselves. Depending on which company you contracted with, you can find detailed information in the _Legal Documents_ section for [Iron Hive doo Beograd (Serbia)](https://yandex.com/legal/cloud_customer_agreement/) or [Direct Cursus Technology L.L.C. (Dubai)](https://yandex.com/legal/cloud_customer_agreement_uae/).


A payment invoice is not a primary accounting document. There are no special legal requirements for drafting this document. In accounting, correct charges for services are made based on reports and tax invoices where all the required details are specified. A payment invoice is generated automatically and there is no way to change customer data.
