Funds are automatically debited from the bank card linked to the billing account at the beginning of the next reporting month if the total debited amount is greater than zero.


 {% note info %}

 {{ yandex-cloud }} reserves the right to automatically debit funds during the current reporting period if your account balance exceeds the established [billing threshold](../concepts/billing-threshold.md).

 {% endnote %}




If you do not have enough funds on your credit/debit card on the day when funds are to be debited, the debit transaction will be repeated later.
