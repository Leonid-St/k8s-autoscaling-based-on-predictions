You can monitor your balance in [**{{ billing-name }}**]({{ link-console-billing }}):
- Your balance automatically reduces as you consume resources. You can view your usage history on the [usage details](../operations/check-charges.md) page.
- Your balance increases when you top up your account. The top-up record is logged to the [payment history](../operations/check-bill-history.md).
