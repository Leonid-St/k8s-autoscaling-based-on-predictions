# Video player SDK

You can use the following SDKs to embed a [video player](../concepts/player.md) with content from {{ video-name }} into a website or application:
* [Video player SDK for IFrame](../iframe-sdk.md)
* [Video player SDK for iOS](./ios-sdk.md)
* [Video player SDK for JavaScript](./javascript/index.md)

We are also planning to add an SDK for Android going forward.
