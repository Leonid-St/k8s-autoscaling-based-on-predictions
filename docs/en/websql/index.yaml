    Yandex WebSQL is a Yandex Cloud service that allows you to connect to
    managed database clusters, work with DBs, tables, and schemas, and run
    queries. It is a web-based tool that requires no additional authorization
    and simplifies working with SQL commands by suggesting prompts.

    Yandex WebSQL supports integration with Yandex MetaData Hub at the user
    folder level. Connections created in WebSQL automatically appear in MetaData
    Hub Connection Manager and vice versa.
