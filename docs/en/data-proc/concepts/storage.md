# Storage in {{ dataproc-name }}

{{ dataproc-name }} enables you to use network storage drives to store subclusters. Network storage drives are based on network blocks, which are virtual disks in the {{ yandex-cloud }} infrastructure.

When creating a cluster, you can choose between the following storage types:

* Network HDD storage (`network-hdd`): Most cost-effective option for clusters that do not require high read/write performance.
* Network SSD storage (`network-ssd`): Balanced solution. Such storage is slower than the one based on non-replicated SSD disks; however, it ensures data integrity in case {{ yandex-cloud }} hardware goes down.
* Non-replicated SSD storage (`network-ssd-nonreplicated`): Network SSD storage with enhanced performance but without redundancy.

   The size of such storage can only be increased in 93Â GB increments.

   For more information about this disk type, see the [{{ compute-full-name }} documentation](../../compute/concepts/disk.md#nr-disks).

## Specifics of non-replicated SSD storage {#network-nrd-storage-features}

Non-replicated SSD storage does not provide fault tolerance; this means, if a disk fails, the data is permanently lost.
