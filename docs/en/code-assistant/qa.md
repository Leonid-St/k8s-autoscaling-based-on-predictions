# FAQ about {{ ca-full-name }}

## General questions about {#common-questions}

### Which IDE versions are supported? {#ide-versions}

{% include [supported-versions](../_includes/code-assistant/supported-versions.md) %}

### Do I need a billing account to work with {{ ca-name }}? {#billing-account}

You **do not need** a [billing account](../billing/concepts/billing-account.md).

### Can I use the plugin without internet access? {#using-plugin-without-internet}

No. To work with {{ ca-name }}, you will need continuous internet access.

### How to change the user authenticated in the {{ ca-name }} plugin {#change-user}

To authenticate in the {{ ca-name }} plugin as another {{ yandex-cloud }} user, [log out](./quickstart.md#logout) of your current account and re-authenticate as described in step 3 of [{#T}](./quickstart.md#install-plugin).

### Error getting a refresh token {#refresh-token}

Error message:

```text
Error refreshing token: no refresh token found
```

Your [organization](../overview/roles-and-resources.md) does not allow issuing [refresh tokens](../iam/api-ref/RefreshToken/) used by {{ ca-name }} for authentication. To work with {{ ca-name }}, [register](../getting-started/) in {{ yandex-cloud }} using your personal [Yandex account](../iam/concepts/users/accounts.md#passport) and [create](../organization/operations/enable-org.md) a new organization.
