The `iam.serviceAccounts.tokenCreator` role enables getting IAM tokens for service accounts.

With such an [IAM token](../../../iam/concepts/authorization/iam-token.md) one can [impersonate](../../../iam/concepts/access-control/index.md#impersonation) to a [service account](../../../iam/concepts/users/accounts.md#sa) and perform operations allowed for it.

This role does not allow you to modify access permissions or delete a service account.
