The `iam.serviceAccounts.user` role enables viewing the list of service accounts and info on them, as well as performing operations on behalf of a service account.

For example, if you specify a [service account](../../../iam/concepts/users/accounts.md#sa) when creating an instance group, IAM will check whether you have a permission to use this service account.
