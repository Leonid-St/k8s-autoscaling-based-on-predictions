The `datasphere.community-projects.admin` role allows you to manage access to projects, work in them, modify and delete them, as well as manage project resources and share them within the community.

Users with this role can:
* View info on granted [access permissions](../../../iam/concepts/access-control/index.md) for projects and modify access permissions.
* View info on [projects](../../../datasphere/concepts/project.md), project settings, and project resources, as well as modify and delete projects.
* Create, modify, and delete [resources](../../../datasphere/concepts/resources.md) within projects, as well as share the relevant project resources with the communities where the user has the `Developer` role (`datasphere.communities.developer`) or higher.
* Run IDEs and code cells in projects.

This role also includes the `datasphere.community-projects.editor` permissions.

In the DataSphere interface, users with the `datasphere.community-projects.admin` role have the `Admin` role in the **Members** tab on the community page.
