The `loadtesting.generatorClient` role allows you to create, modify, and run load tests using an agent, as well as enables uploading test results to the storage.

Users with this role can:
* Create, edit, and run load tests.
* Create and edit load test configurations.
* Upload the test [result](../../load-testing/concepts/load-test-results.md) data to the storage.

Assign this role to the [service account](../../iam/concepts/users/service-accounts.md) under which you create a VM with an [agent](../../load-testing/concepts/agent.md).
