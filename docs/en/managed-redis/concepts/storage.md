# Disk types in {{ mrd-name }}



{{ mrd-name }} allows you to use network and local storage drives for database clusters. Network drives are based on network blocks, which are virtual disks in the {{ yandex-cloud }} infrastructure. Local disks are physically located on the database host servers.

## Selecting the disk type during cluster creation {#storage-type-selection}

The number of hosts you can create together with a {{ VLK }} cluster depends on the disk type you select and whether you enabled [sharding](./sharding.md):

| Disk type                                                             | Non-sharded cluster  | Sharded cluster    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------|
| Network SSDs (`network-ssd`), ultra high-speed network SSDs with three replicas (`network-ssd-io-m3`)                           | 1 host or more                         | 1 host or more (1 shard × 1 host)     |
| Local SSDs (`local-ssd`)                           | 3 hosts or more                        | 2 hosts or more (1 shard × 2 hosts)    |
| Non-replicated SSDs (`network-ssd-nonreplicated`)     | 3 hosts or more                        | 3 hosts or more (1 shard × 3 hosts)    |

Sharded clusters with the **local-ssd** disk type and only one host per shard are not considered fault-tolerant. You cannot create such a cluster.

For more information about limits on the number of hosts per cluster or shard, see [Quotas and limits](./limits.md).
