title: Deleting a {{ VLK }} cluster
description: After you delete a {{ VLK }} database cluster, its backups will be kept for seven days for recovery purposes. To restore a deleted cluster from a backup you will need its ID; therefore, make sure the cluster ID is secure before deleting the cluster.

  To delete a cluster, run the command:
  
  ```bash

  ```

  You can request the cluster ID and name with the [list of clusters in the folder](cluster-list.md).

- {{ TF }} {#tf}

    {% include [terraform-delete-mdb-cluster](../../_includes/mdb/terraform-delete-mdb-cluster.md) %}

    {% include [Terraform timeouts](../../_includes/mdb/mrd/terraform/timeouts.md) %}

- REST API {#api}

    1. [Get an IAM token for API authentication](../api-ref/authentication.md) and put it into the environment variable:

        {% include [api-auth-token](../../_includes/mdb/api-auth-token.md) %}

    1. Use the [Cluster.Delete](../api-ref/Cluster/delete.md) method and send the following request, e.g., via {{ api-examples.rest.tool }}:

        ```bash
        curl \
            --request DELETE \
            --header "Authorization: Bearer $IAM_TOKEN" \
            --url 'https://{{ api-host-mdb }}/managed-redis/v1/clusters/<cluster_ID>'
        ```

        You can request the cluster ID with the [list of clusters in the folder](cluster-list.md#list-clusters).

    1. View the [server response](../api-ref/Cluster/delete.md#yandex.cloud.operation.Operation) to make sure the request was successful.

- gRPC API {#grpc-api}

    1. [Get an IAM token for API authentication](../api-ref/authentication.md) and put it into the environment variable:

        {% include [api-auth-token](../../_includes/mdb/api-auth-token.md) %}

    1. {% include [grpc-api-setup-repo](../../_includes/mdb/grpc-api-setup-repo.md) %}

    1. Use the [ClusterService.Delete](../api-ref/grpc/Cluster/delete.md) call and send the following request, e.g., via {{ api-examples.grpc.tool }}:

        ```bash
        grpcurl \
            -format json \
            -import-path ~/cloudapi/ \
            -import-path ~/cloudapi/third_party/googleapis/ \
            -proto ~/cloudapi/yandex/cloud/mdb/redis/v1/cluster_service.proto \
            -rpc-header "Authorization: Bearer $IAM_TOKEN" \
            -d '{
                  "cluster_id": "<cluster_ID>"
                }' \
            {{ api-host-mdb }}:{{ port-https }} \
            yandex.cloud.mdb.redis.v1.ClusterService.Delete
        ```

        You can request the cluster ID with the [list of clusters in the folder](cluster-list.md#list-clusters).

    1. View the [server response](../api-ref/grpc/Cluster/delete.md#yandex.cloud.operation.Operation) to make sure the request was successful.
