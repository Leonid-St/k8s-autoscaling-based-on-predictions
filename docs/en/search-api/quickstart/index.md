# Getting started with {{ search-api-name }}

{{ search-api-name }} provides two interfaces for requests: [API v2](../concepts/index.md#api-v2), which is natively integrated into the [{{ yandex-cloud }} ecosystem](../../overview/concepts/services.md) and supports POST requests, and the original Yandex XML-compatible [API v1](../concepts/index.md#api-v1), which supports [GET](../concepts/get-request.md) and [POST](../concepts/post-request.md) requests.

Select the interface to explore {{ search-api-full-name }} with:

* [{#T}](../quickstart.md)
* [{#T}](./v2.md)
