# Getting started with {{ search-api-name }} via API v1

Follow this guide if you have used Yandex XML before and seek to set up your workflow in {{ search-api-name }} via [API v1](./concepts/index.md#api-v1), its Yandex XML-compatible interface.

Instead of API v1, we recommend that you use the more modern [API v2](./quickstart/v2.md) interface.

## Getting started {#before-you-begin}

{% include [before-begin](../_tutorials/_tutorials_includes/before-you-begin.md) %}

## Registration {#registration}

{% include [registration](../_includes/search-api/registration.md) %}

## Run a test request in the management console {#test-request}

{% include [test-request](../_includes/search-api/test-request.md) %}

## Get started with the service {#get-going}

Once you have learned how to generate queries to {{ search-api-name }}'s API v1, move on to [running search queries](./operations/searching.md) as part of your standard operations.
