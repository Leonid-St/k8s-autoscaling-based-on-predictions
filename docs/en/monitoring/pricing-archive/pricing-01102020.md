# Pricing rules for {{ monitoring-full-name }} before October 1, 2020

## What goes into the cost of using {{ monitoring-short-name }} {#rules}

The cost of using {{ monitoring-short-name }} only includes writing custom metrics via the [API](../api-ref/index.md).

Pricing features:
* After uploading the first 50 million values, the upload cost is reduced. See [Prices](#prices).
* {{ yandex-cloud }} resource metrics, as well as incoming and outgoing traffic, are free.

### Pricing {#prices}

The minimum billing unit is 1 metric value. The price is rounded up to the nearest hundredth of a ruble.

For example, the cost of writing the first 86,400 values is `₽0.6048`, which is rounded to `₽0.60`. The cost of writing the first 87,000 values is `₽0.609`, which is rounded to `₽0.61`.

Service | Price per one million values, <br>incl. VAT
----- | -----
Uploading custom values via the API<br/>(up to 50 million values) | ₽7.00
Uploading custom values via the API<br/>(more than 50 million values) | ₽4.00
Downloading custom metric values via the API | ₽0

### Cost calculation example {#example}

Let's say you write to {{ monitoring-short-name }} 20 metrics at a rate of **1 value per minute**. In 30 days, your amount written will be: 

>20 metrics * 1 value/min * 60 minutes * 24 hours * 30 days = 864,000 values = 0.864 million values

Thus, the cost of 30 days worth of the service will be `0.864 million values * ₽7 = ₽6.05`.

If you write 20 metrics at a rate of **1 value per second**, in 30 days your total written will be: 

>20 metrics * 1 value/second * 60 seconds * 60 minutes * 24 hours * 30 days = 51,840,000 values = 51.84 million values

In which case the cost of 30 days worth of the service will be `50 million values * ₽7 + (51.84 - 50) million values * ₽4 = ₽357.36`.
