# {{ monitoring-full-name }} release notes


## October – November 2024 {#oct-nov-2024}

* **Added phone calls** as a notification channel to make an automated call to the user when an alert triggers (currently available for escalations only).

* Added the [escalation](concepts/alerting/escalations.md) feature you can invoke when an alert gets the **Alarm** status. An escalation starts a sequence of notifications with a preset interval. You can configure sending notifications to different channels for one or more cloud users.

  This feature is available at the [Preview](../overview/concepts/launch-stages.md) stage.

* Implemented integration with [{{ sf-name }}](../functions/index.yaml). You can now invoke a function using any of the available [programming languages](../functions/concepts/) when an alert triggers (currently available for escalations only).

* Added support for [alerting rules](operations/prometheus/alerting-rules.md) in {{ managed-prometheus-full-name }}. You can send notifications for {{ prometheus-name }} metrics via email, Telegram, text messages (SMS), and other channels.
  
  This feature is available at the [Preview](../overview/concepts/launch-stages.md) stage.

* Updated the **Metric Explorer** interface to allow a more consistent and detailed data analysis:

  * Query string is now located at the top so you can type in queries and view results in charts with more ease. You can add and edit multiple queries: all the queries and charts are available from a single screen.
  * You can add a name and description for charts.
  * Added sorting for each chart metric to the legend window. Also now you can highlight a chart line with a specific metric and open the chart in a separate window.
  * Optimized query editing in [token mode](concepts/visualization/query-string.md) for the use of a keyboard. Added keyboard shortcuts for managing and navigating tokens.
  * Placed the chart legend on the **Pivot table** tab. Next to it, you can find the **Source data** table with service metrics.
  
* Updated the [**Dashboards**](concepts/visualization/dashboard.md) interface with new features:
  * Now you do not need to switch to editing mode to add an element to a dashboard: you can begin the setup right away.
  * You can create duplicate charts for each of the selected metric value in a [dashboard parameter](concepts/visualization/dashboard.md#parameterization).
  * You can add an [alert widget](operations/dashboard/add-widget.md#alert) to a dashboard and monitor its status.
  * Improved the speed of loading and updating charts.
  * Improved the widget loading speed and performance.
