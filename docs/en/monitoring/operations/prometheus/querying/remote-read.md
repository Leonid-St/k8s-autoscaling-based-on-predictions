# Reading metrics via the Remote API

1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), select the folder where the data is stored.
1. [Create a service account](../../../../iam/operations/sa/create.md) with the `{{ roles-monitoring-viewer }}` role for the selected folder.
1. [Create an API key](../../../../iam/operations/api-key/create.md) for the service account.
1. Add the endpoint (`url`) to the `remote_read` section of the [Prometheus configuration](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#remote_read):
   ```yaml
   ...
   remote_read:
     ...
     - url: '<URL>' # Available on request
       bearer_token: '<API_key>'
       # Or via a file (recommended):
       # bearer_token_file: '<name_of_file_with_API_key>'

       # We recommend adding the X-Lookback-Delta custom header.
       # If you did not change the lookback-delta parameter value in
       # your Prometheus instance configuration, specify the default value, 5m.
       # This information is required for optimized decimation.
       headers:
         X-Lookback-Delta: 5m

       # By default, data is only requested for the time ranges
       # not featured in the Prometheus local storage (older than the Storage retention).
       # If you want to be able to request data always, which makes sense if read and write operations
       # are made from different Prometheus instances, enable the following option:
       # [ read_recent: true ]

       # If you want to read only some metrics via the Remote API, specify their labels:
       # required_matchers:
       # [ <label_name>: <label_value> ... ]
   ```
1. Restart {{ prometheus-name }} or reload the configuration.
