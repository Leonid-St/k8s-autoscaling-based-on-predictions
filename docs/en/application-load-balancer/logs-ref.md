# {{ alb-full-name }} log reference

This section describes the various fields of the logs generated by the L7 load balancer. 

Logs are provided in JSON format. A single log entry represents one client request to the load balancer. 

For more information, see [Logging](./concepts/application-load-balancer.md#logging).

`error_details` | Error encountered by the load balancer when processing a request. The possible values are: <ul><li>`no_healthy_backend`: No healthy backends. For more information, see [Health checks](./concepts/backend-group.md#health-checks).</li><li>`backend_request_timeout`: Backend request timeout specified in the route settings was exceeded.</li><li>`balancer_reset`: Connection between the client and the load balancer was reset.</li><li>`backend_connection_closed_before_data_sent_to_client`: Connection between the load balancer and the backend was reset.</li><li>`failed_to_connect_to_backend`: Load balancer failed to connect to the backend.</li><li>`backend_connection_terminated`: Backend closed the connection with the load balancer.</li><li>`no_route`: Client's request does not match any routes configured in the load balancer HTTP routers.</li><li>`client_disconnected`: Client closed the connection with the load balancer.</li><li>`backend_stream_idle_timeout`: Idle timeout specified in the route settings was exceeded: the connection between the load balancer and the backend was idle for too long with no data transmission.</li><li>`backend_retry_limit_exceeded`: Load balancer exceeded the maximum number of backend connection attempts.</li><li>`client_protocol_error`: Client protocol error.</li></ul>
`tls_version` | TLS version, e.g., `TLSv1.3`.

`server_certificate_subject` | Domain name on the TLS certificate sent to the client by the load balancer.
`grpc` | gRPC request information. Returned for gRPC requests only (`"type": "grpc"` or `"type": "grpcs"`).
&ensp; `method` | gRPC request method.
&ensp; `service` | gRPC service name.
&ensp; `status` | gRPC request status.
&emsp;&emsp; `code` | gRPC request error code. For more information about the gRPC statuses that correspond to HTTP codes, see [google.rpc.Code](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/rpc/code.proto).
&emsp;&emsp; `message` | gRPC request error description.
`upstream_transport_failure_reason` | Error message regarding a transport-layer connection error between the load balancer and backend, such as in the TLS connection.
`request_processing_times` | Information about the time it took to process a request. All field values are specified in seconds.
&ensp; `request_time` | Total time it took to handle a request.
&ensp; `response_start_time` | Time before the start of a response: between when the first request byte is received from the client by the load balancer and when the first byte of the response is sent by the load balancer to the client.
&ensp; `request_processing_time` | Time the load balancer takes to process a request: between receiving the first byte from the client and sending the first byte to the backend.
&ensp; `backend_processing_time` | Time it takes the backend to process a request: between the load balancer sending the first byte to and receiving the first byte from the backend.
&ensp; `response_processing_time` | Time it takes the load balancer to process a response: between receiving the first byte from the backend and sending the first byte to the client.
&ensp; `request_rx_time` | Time it takes the load balancer to receive a request: between the first and the last bytes received from the client.
&ensp; `request_tx_time` | Time it takes the backend to receive a request: between the first and the last bytes sent by the load balancer.
&ensp; `backend_response_time` | Wait time for a backend response: between the load balancer sending the last byte of a request to and receiving the first byte of the response from the backend.
&ensp; `response_rx_time` | Time it takes the backend to send a response: between the first and the last bytes received by the load balancer.
&ensp; `response_tx_time` | Time it takes the load balancer to send a response: between the first and the last bytes sent by the load balancer.
`x_forwarded_for` | Value of the incoming request [X-Forwarded-For](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Forwarded-For) (XFF) header containing the IP addresses of the forwarding nodes. `client_ip` comes first, followed by IP addresses of any intermediate nodes, if any. For example:<ul><li>`x_forwarded_for: 50.0.0.1`: Request came directly from a single client. {{ alb-name }} added its `client_ip` to the header.</li><li>`x_forwarded_for: 50.0.0.1,40.0.0.1`: Proxy server was used for the request. {{ alb-name }} added the proxy IP address after `client_ip` in the header.</li></ul>
