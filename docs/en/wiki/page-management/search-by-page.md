# Finding text on a page

You can find a specific word or phrase on a {{ wiki-name }} page, the search also covering the unloaded content of this page. That is, if your page features a dynamic table the content of which has not fully loaded, it will also be included in the search.

To initiate a search, click ![](../../_assets/wiki/svg/actions-icon.svg) **Actions** in the top-right corner of the page and select ![](../../_assets/wiki/svg/search.svg) **Find on page**, or use the following hotkeys:
* Windows and Linux: **Ctrl** + **Shift** + **F**
* macOS: **⌘** + **Shift** + **F**

If the single-page search did not produce the results you were looking for, [search all pages](../search.md) to which you have access.

{% note info %}

To search through a page in edit mode, use these hotkeys:
* Windows and Linux: **Ctrl** + **F**
* macOS: **⌘** + **F**

{% endnote %}
