# Creating a fixed-size instance group with a network load balancer


You can create a fixed-size [instance group](../../concepts/instance-groups/index.md) integrated with [{{ network-load-balancer-full-name }}](../../../network-load-balancer/). Along with the [instance](../../concepts/vm.md) group, the system will also create a {{ network-load-balancer-name }} [target group](../../../network-load-balancer/concepts/target-resources.md). You can link it to your [network load balancer](../../../network-load-balancer/concepts/index.md) and distribute the load across the instances in the group at the network level. For more information, see [{#T}](../../concepts/instance-groups/balancers.md).

{% include [warning.md](../../../_includes/instance-groups/warning.md) %}

{% include [sa.md](../../../_includes/instance-groups/sa.md) %}

To create, update, and delete VM instances in your group, as well as integrate the group with {{ network-load-balancer-name }}, you will need to [assign](../../../iam/operations/sa/assign-role-for-sa.md) the [compute.editor](../../security/index.md#compute-editor) and [load-balancer.editor](../../../network-load-balancer/security/index.md#load-balancer-editor) roles to the service account.

To create an instance group with a network load balancer:

{% list tabs group=instructions %}

- Management console {#console}

  1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), select the [folder](../../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#folder) where you want to create your instance group.
  1. In the list of services, select **{{ ui-key.yacloud.iam.folder.dashboard.label_compute }}**.
  1. In the left-hand panel, select ![image](../../../_assets/console-icons/layers-3-diagonal.svg) **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.switch_groups }}**.
  1. Click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.groups.button_create }}**.
  1. Under **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.groups.create.section_base }}**:
     * Enter a name and description for your instance group. The naming requirements are as follows:

       {% include [name-format](../../../_includes/name-format.md) %}

       {% include [name-fqdn](../../../_includes/compute/name-fqdn.md) %}

     * Select the [service account](../../../iam/concepts/users/service-accounts.md) from the list or create a new one. To create, update, and delete VM instances in your group, as well as integrate the group with {{ network-load-balancer-name }}, you will need to [assign](../../../iam/operations/sa/assign-role-for-sa.md) the [compute.editor](../../security/index.md#compute-editor) and [load-balancer.editor](../../../network-load-balancer/security/index.md#load-balancer-editor) roles to a service account. By default, all operations you perform with an instance group are run under a service account.

       * `{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.groups.create.value_strategy-opportunistic }}`: {{ compute-name }} waits for the instances to stop on their own or for the user to stop them.
  1. Under **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.groups.create.section_scale }}**:

  1. Create an instance group in the default folder:

     ```bash
     {{ yc-compute-ig }} create --file specification.yaml
     ```

     This command will create a group of three same-type instances with the following configuration:
     * Name: `first-fixed-group-with-balancer`.
     * OS: CentOS 7.
     * Network: `default-net`.
     * Availability zone: `{{ region-id }}-a`.
     * vCPUs: 2; RAM: 2 GB.
     * Network HDD: 32 GB.
     * Target group: `first-target-group`.
  1. [Create a network load balancer](../../../network-load-balancer/operations/load-balancer-create.md) and add `first-target-group` to it.

     {% note info %}

     If you already have suitable resources, such as a service account, cloud network, subnet, and network load balancer, you do not need to redefine them. Specify their names and IDs in the appropriate parameters.

     {% endnote %}

     For more information about the resources you can create with {{ TF }}, see the [relevant provider documentation]({{ tf-provider-link }}).
  1. Create the resources:

     {% include [terraform-validate-plan-apply](../../../_tutorials/_tutorials_includes/terraform-validate-plan-apply.md) %}

     This will create all the resources you need in the specified folder. You can check the new resources and their settings using the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}).

- API {#api}

  Use the [create](../../instancegroup/api-ref/InstanceGroup/create.md) REST API method for the [InstanceGroup](../../instancegroup/api-ref/InstanceGroup/index.md) resource or the [InstanceGroupService/Create](../../instancegroup/api-ref/grpc/InstanceGroup/create.md) gRPC API call.
