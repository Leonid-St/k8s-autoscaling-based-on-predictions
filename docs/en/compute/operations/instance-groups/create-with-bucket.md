# Creating an instance group connected to {{ objstorage-full-name }}


One of the ways to handle [stateful workloads](../../concepts/instance-groups/stateful-workload.md) is to store the application state in an [{{ objstorage-name }} bucket](../../../storage/concepts/bucket.md) independent of the instance group.

To create an instance group that will automatically connect a common {{ objstorage-name }} bucket to each of its instances:

1. {% include [sa.md](../../../_includes/instance-groups/sa.md) %}
1. To be able to create, update, and delete VMs in the group, [assign](../../../iam/operations/sa/assign-role-for-sa.md) the [compute.editor](../../security/index.md#compute-editor) role to the service account.
1. If you do not have an {{ objstorage-name }} bucket, [create one](../../../storage/operations/buckets/create.md).
1. Bucket operations are performed under the service account created within the same [folder](../../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#folder) as the bucket. If there is no such service account, create one. To work with the bucket, assign the `storage.editor` [role](../../../storage/security/index.md#storage-editor) to the service account.

    You can use either a single service account or two separate service accounts for working with the instance group and the bucket.

1. Create an instance group:

    {% list tabs group=instructions %}

    - CLI {#cli}

      {% include [cli-install.md](../../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

      {% include [default-catalogue.md](../../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

      1. See the description of the [CLI](../../../cli/) command for creating an instance group:

         ```bash
         {{ yc-compute-ig }} create --help
         ```

      1. Check whether the [folder](../../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#folder) contains any [networks](../../../vpc/concepts/network.md#network):

         ```bash
         yc vpc network list
         ```

         If there are no networks, [create one](../../../vpc/operations/network-create.md).
      1. Select one of the {{ marketplace-full-name }} public images, e.g., [Ubuntu 22.04 LTS](/marketplace/products/yc/ubuntu-22-04-lts).

         {% include [standard-images.md](../../../_includes/standard-images.md) %}

      1. Prepare a file with the [YAML specification](../../concepts/instance-groups/specification.md) of the instance group and give it a name, e.g., `specification.yaml`.

          To connect a bucket to instances in the instance group, add the following to the specification:

          * In the `instance_template` field, a nested `service_account_id` field containing the [ID](../../../iam/operations/sa/get-id.md) of the service account with the `storage.editor` role assigned to it:

              ```yml
              instance_template:
                ...
                service_account_id: <service_account_ID>
              ```

              For more granular access management, link different service accounts with different permissions to the instance group and individual instances within that group.

          * In the `#cloud-config` section of the `instance_template.metadata.user-data` field, commands for mounting the bucket to the instance:

              ```yml
              instance_template:
                ...
                metadata:
                  user-data: |-
                    #cloud-config
                    ...
                    runcmd:
                      - apt-get install fuse
                      - wget https://github.com/yandex-cloud/geesefs/releases/latest/download/geesefs-linux-amd64
                      - chmod a+x geesefs-linux-amd64
                      - cp geesefs-linux-amd64 /usr/bin/geesefs
                      - mkdir <instance_mount_point>
                      - echo "user_allow_other" | tee -a /etc/fuse.conf
                      - echo "<bucket_name>    <instance_mount_point>    fuse.geesefs    _netdev,allow_other,--iam    0   0" | tee -a /etc/fstab
                      - mount -a
              ```

              Where:
              * `- apt-get install fuse`: Command for installing [FUSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_in_Userspace). This command can run on Ubuntu and Debian. For operating systems based on Red Hat (such as CentOS and Fedora), use the `- yum install fuse` command, for OpenSUSE, `- zypper install fuse`, etc.
              * `<instance_mount_point>`: Instance directory to mount the connected bucket to, e.g., `/mnt/gfs0`.
              * `<bucket_name>`: [Name of the bucket](../../../storage/concepts/bucket.md#naming) to connect to the instance.

          Here is a YAML specification example:

          ```yml

          This example shows a specification for [creating a fixed-size instance group](./create-fixed-group.md) with an {{ objstorage-name }} bucket connected to the instances.

          For more information about the instance group specification parameters, see [{#T}](../../concepts/instance-groups/specification.md).

      1. Create an instance group in the default folder:

          ```bash
          {{ yc-compute-ig }} create --file specification.yaml
          ```

         This command will create a group of two same-type instances with the following configuration:
         * Name: `my-vm-group-with-object-storage`.
         * OS: `Ubuntu 22.04 LTS`.
         * Availability zone: `{{ region-id }}-a`.
         * vCPU: 2, RAM: 2 GB.
         * Network [HDD](../../concepts/disk.md#disks-types): 32 GB.
         * Connected to an {{ objstorage-name }} bucket. The bucket will be mounted to the `/mnt/gfs0` directory of the group instances.
         * {% include [ssh-connection-internal-ip](../../../_includes/instance-groups/ssh-connection-internal-ip.md) %}

      1. In the configuration file, define the parameters of the resources you want to create:

            If you already have suitable resources, such as service accounts, a cloud network, and a subnet, you do not need to redefine them. Specify their names and IDs in the appropriate parameters.

          For more information about the resources you can create with {{ TF }}, see the [relevant provider documentation]({{ tf-provider-link }}).

      1. Create the resources:

          {% include [terraform-validate-plan-apply](../../../_tutorials/_tutorials_includes/terraform-validate-plan-apply.md) %}

          All the resources you need will then be created in the specified folder. You can check the new resources and their settings using the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}).

          {% include [ssh-connection-internal-ip](../../../_includes/instance-groups/ssh-connection-internal-ip.md) %}

    - API {#api}

      Use the [create](../../instancegroup/api-ref/InstanceGroup/create.md) REST API method for the [InstanceGroup](../../instancegroup/api-ref/InstanceGroup/index.md) resource or the [InstanceGroupService/Create](../../instancegroup/api-ref/grpc/InstanceGroup/create.md) gRPC API call.

    {% endlist %}

Make sure the bucket is connected to the group instances. For this, [connect](../vm-connect/ssh.md#vm-connect) to the instances via SSH and navigate to the directory you specified as the mount point.
