# Getting started with a serial console


A serial console enables accessing a [VM](../../concepts/vm.md) regardless of the [network](../../../vpc/concepts/network.md#network) or OS state. For example, you can use the console to troubleshoot your VM or when you have SSH access issues.

To use the serial console, you need the `compute.admin` or `{{ roles-editor }}` [role](../../security/index.md).

By default, serial console access is disabled.

{% include [sc-warning](../../../_includes/compute/serial-console-warning.md) %}

## Getting started {#before-you-begin}

Before you enable serial console access on a VM:
1. Prepare a key pair (public and private keys) for SSH access to your VM. The serial console authenticates users via SSH keys.
1. Create a text file, e.g., `sshkeys.txt`, and specify the following:

   ```txt
   <username>:<public_SSH_key_for_user>
   ```

   Example of a text file for `yc-user`:

   ```txt
   yc-user:ssh-ed25519 AAAAB3Nza......OjbSMRX yc-user@example.com
   ```

   By default, user SSH keys are stored in the user's `~/.ssh` folder. You can get a public key by running the `cat ~/.ssh/<public_key_name>.pub` command.

## Enabling the console when creating a VM from a public image {#turn-on-for-new-instance}

To enable serial console access when creating a VM, set the `serial-port-enable` parameter in the [metadata](../../concepts/vm-metadata.md) to `1`.

{% include [cli-install](../../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

{% include [default-catalogue](../../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

{% list tabs group=operating_system %}

- Linux {#linux}

  1. See the description of the CLI command for creating a VM:

     ```bash
     yc compute instance create --help
     ```

  1. Select a public Linux-based [image](../../concepts/image.md), e.g., Ubuntu.

     {% include [standard-images](../../../_includes/standard-images.md) %}

  1. Create a VM in the default [folder](../../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#folder):

     ```bash
     yc compute instance create \
       --name first-instance \
       --zone {{ region-id }}-a \
       --network-interface subnet-name=default-a,nat-ip-version=ipv4 \
       --create-boot-disk image-folder-id=standard-images,image-family=ubuntu-1604-lts \
       --metadata-from-file ssh-keys=sshkeys.txt \
       --metadata serial-port-enable=1
     ```

     This command will create a VM with the following parameters:
     * OS: [Ubuntu](/marketplace?tab=software&search=Ubuntu&categories=os)
     * Name: `first-instance`
     * [Availability zone](../../../overview/concepts/geo-scope.md): `{{ region-id }}-a`
     * Serial console: Active

     A user named `yc-user` with the specified public key will be automatically created in the VM OS.

{% endlist %}

## Enabling the console when updating a VM {#turn-on-for-current-instance}

To enable serial console access when updating a VM, set the `serial-port-enable` parameter in the metadata to `1`.
1. Get a list of VMs in the default folder:

   {% include [compute-instance-list](../../_includes_service/compute-instance-list.md) %}

1. Select `ID` or `NAME` of the VM, e.g., `first-instance`.

1. Set `serial-port-enable=1` in the VM metadata:

   ```bash
   yc compute instance add-metadata \
     --name first-instance \
     --metadata-from-file ssh-keys=sshkeys.txt \
     --metadata serial-port-enable=1
   ```

   The command will start activating the serial console on the VM named `first-instance`.

## Configuring a VM to enable serial port access {#configuration}

To configure serial console access, a VM must have a [public IP address](../../../vpc/concepts/address.md#public-addresses). You can look up the address in the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}) in the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.iam.folder.dashboard.label_compute }}** section, the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.switch_instances }}** page. If you created a VM without a public IP address, you can [assign one](../vm-control/vm-attach-public-ip.md). Once the configuration is complete, you can unassign the address as you will not need it for connecting via the serial console.

For the serial console to be accessible from the OS side, configure the OS accordingly.

### Linux {#linux-configuration}

To connect to a Linux serial console, make sure [SSH password authentication is disabled](#ssh-pass-off) and [set a password](#create-pass) for the OS user, if required.

#### Disabling SSH password authentication {#ssh-pass-off}

{% include [vm-connect-ssh-linux-note](../../../_includes/vm-connect-ssh-linux-note.md) %}

If you are using a custom image, make sure SSH access with a username and password is disabled.

To disable SSH password authentication:
1. Open the SSH server configuration file (`/etc/ssh/sshd_config` by default). Only a superuser has read and write permissions for the file.
1. Set `PasswordAuthentication` to `no`.
1. Restart the SSH server:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart ssh*
   ```

#### Creating a password for a Linux user {#create-pass}

Some operating systems may prompt you for your user credentials to access the VM. So, before connecting to VMs running on such systems, create a local password for the default user.

To create a local password, use the CLI.
1. Get a list of VMs in the default folder:

   {% include [compute-instance-list](../../_includes_service/compute-instance-list.md) %}

1. Select `ID` or `NAME` of the VM, e.g., `first-instance`.
1. Get the public IP address of your VM:

   ```bash
   yc compute instance get first-instance
   ```

   In the command output, find the VM address in the `one_to_one_nat` section:

   ```bash
   ...
   one_to_one_nat:
     address: <public_IP_address>
     ip_version: IPV4
   ...
   ```

1. Connect to the VM. For more information, see [{#T}](../vm-connect/ssh.md#vm-connect).
1. Create a local password. In Linux, you can set a password using the `passwd` command:

   ```bash
   sudo passwd <username>
   ```

   Example for `yc-user`:

   ```bash
   sudo passwd yc-user
   ```

1. Terminate the SSH session by running `exit`.

#### Enable the authorization method you need {#ssh-authorization}

{% list tabs %}

- SSH key
