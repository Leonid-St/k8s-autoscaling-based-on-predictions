# AWS SDK for Java


The [AWS SDK for Java](https://aws.amazon.com/ru/sdk-for-java/) is an {{ objstorage-full-name }}-compatible software development kit for integration with AWS services.

You will use the AWS SDK for Java to create a bucket, load it with objects, clean up its contents, and delete it.

## Getting started {#before-you-begin}

{% include [aws-tools-prepare](../../_includes/aws-tools/aws-tools-prepare.md) %}

{% include [access-bucket-sa](../../_includes/storage/access-bucket-sa.md) %}

## Installation {#installation}

{% note warning %}

Starting December 31, 2025, support for the AWS SDK for Java version 1.x will be discontinued. We recommend that you upgrade to the AWS SDK for Java version 2.x to keep receiving new features and security updates.

## Setup {#setup}

- AWS SDK v2.x {#sdk-v2}

    1. In the `/src/main/java/org/example` directory, open the `DependencyFactory.java` file and modify the `DependencyFactory` class:

        ```java
        public class DependencyFactory {
            private DependencyFactory() {}
            public static S3Client s3Client() {
                return S3Client.builder()
                .endpointOverride(URI.create("https://{{ s3-storage-host }}"))
                .httpClientBuilder(ApacheHttpClient.builder())
                .build();
            }
        }
        ```

    1. [Run the code](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/latest/developer-guide/get-started.html#get-started-run) as described in the AWS guide.

    See [this repository](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/main/javav2/example_code/s3/src/main/java/com/example/s3) for other examples of using the AWS SDK for Java.

- AWS SDK v1.x {#sdk-v1}
    
    In the `aws-java-sdk/samples/AmazonS3` directory, the SDK distribution archive contains the code you need to modify.

    To connect to {{ objstorage-name }}, replace the code in the example:

    ```java
    AmazonS3 s3 = AmazonS3ClientBuilder.standard()
        .withCredentials(new AWSStaticCredentialsProvider(credentials))
        .withRegion("us-west-2")
        .build();
    ```

    to

    ```java
    AmazonS3 s3 = AmazonS3ClientBuilder.standard()
        .withCredentials(new AWSStaticCredentialsProvider(credentials))
        .withEndpointConfiguration(
            new AmazonS3ClientBuilder.EndpointConfiguration(
                "{{ s3-storage-host }}","{{ region-id }}"
            )
        )
        .build();
    ```

    See [this repository](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/main/java/example_code/s3/src/main/java/aws/example/s3) for other examples of using the AWS SDK for Java.
