# Object backup

{{ objstorage-name }} ensures reliable storage of your uploaded objects in a replicated store; however, it does not provide dedicated backup tools.

If you want to backup your objects, you can regularly download them from {{ objstorage-name }} and store them in your own infrastructure or in another cloud storage.

To automate the backup process, use the [supported tools](../tools/index.md).
