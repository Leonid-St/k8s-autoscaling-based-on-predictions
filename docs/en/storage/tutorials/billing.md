# Processing files with usage details in {{ billing-name }}

The [{{ billing-name }}](../../billing/index.yaml) service is where you can get information about the amount of resources used, monitor your expenses, and pay for resource consumption. You can send your spending details to {{ objstorage-full-name }} and then process them using [{{ yq-full-name }}](../../query/index.yaml).
