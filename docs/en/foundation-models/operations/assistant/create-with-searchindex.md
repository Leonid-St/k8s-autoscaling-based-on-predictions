# Creating an assistant with a search index

{% include [assistants-preview-stage](../../../_includes/foundation-models/assistants-preview-stage.md) %}

{{ assistant-api }} is a tool for creating [AI assistants](../../concepts/assistant/index.md). It can be used to create personalized assistants, implement a generative response scenario adapted based on external information (known as _retrieval augmented generation_, or RAG), and save the model's request context.

## Getting started {#before-begin}

To use the examples:

{% list tabs group=programming_language %}

- SDK {#sdk}

  {% include [sdk-before-begin-assistants](../../../_includes/foundation-models/sdk-before-begin-assistants.md) %}

{% endlist %}

## Create an assistant {#create-assistant}

This example shows you how to create an [assistant](../../concepts/assistant/index.md) that uses information from files for responses. In the example, we will create an index for full-text search and a simplest chat.

{% list tabs group=programming_language %}

- SDK {#sdk}

  1. Download and unpack the [archive](https://storage.yandexcloud.net/doc-files/tours-example.zip) with examples of files that will be used as an additional source of information. The files contain advertising texts for tours to Bali and Kazakhstan generated by {{ gpt-pro }}.
  1. Create a file named `search-assistant.py` and paste the following code into it:

      {% include [searchindex-assistant](../../../_includes/foundation-models/examples/searchindex-assistant.md) %}

      Where:

      * `mypath`: Variable containing the path to the directory containing the files you downloaded earlier, e.g., `/Users/myuser/tours-example/`.

      {% include [sdk-code-legend](../../../_includes/foundation-models/examples/sdk-code-legend.md) %}

  1. Run the created file:

      ```bash
      python3 search-assistant.py
      ```

      The example implements the simplest chat possible: enter your requests to the assistant from your keyboard and get answers. To end the dialog, enter `exit`.

      {% cut "Approximate result" %}

      ```text
      Enter your question to the assistant: How much is a visa to Bali?
      Answer: 300 rubles.
      Enter your question to the assistant: Do I need a visa to enter Kazakhstan?
      Answer: The text above says that a passport is required to enter Kazakhstan from Russia. It does not mention a visa in the context of traveling to Kazakhstan.

      Answer: the given context provides no information about the cost and necessity of a visa to enter Kazakhstan, but it specifies that a valid passport is required.
      Enter your question to the assistant: Thank you!
      Answer: You are welcome! Is there anything else I can help you with?
      Enter your question to the assistant: exit
