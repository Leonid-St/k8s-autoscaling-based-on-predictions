# Registry in {{ cloud-registry-full-name }}

A _registry_ is a centralized repository as well as a management tool for the various files used in app development and deployment.

Each registry may contain a set of package versions associated with particular resources. To retrieve and publish packages, you can use [Maven CLI](https://maven.apache.org/ref/3-LATEST/maven-embedder/cli.html) or [NPM](art-nodejs.md#npm-inf).

With a registry, you can quickly access the [artifacts](artifacts.md) you need and manage their versions. Using a registry simplifies the process of managing dependencies between the project components. This feature will be of use to development teams working on large and complex projects.

Registries share the same data centers with your infrastructure for speedy performance without needless traffic costs.
