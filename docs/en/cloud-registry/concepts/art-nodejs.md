# Node.js artifact

A _Node.js artifact_ is a package containing the code and relevant information. These packages are used to distribute libraries, frameworks, and other components you can add to [Node.js](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js) projects.

## NPM {#npm-inf}

[NPM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Npm) (Node Package Manager) is a package manager for [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript). It helps developers easily install, update, and manage dependencies in their projects. You can also use it to search, download, and publish packages, as well as create new ones.

By default, Node.js already has NPM, so you do not need to install it manually.

In NPM, artifacts are files with specific content which you can use as dependencies in other projects. Examples of artifacts:
* Packages
* Dependencies
* devDependencies

For more information about NPM, see the [relevant documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/).
