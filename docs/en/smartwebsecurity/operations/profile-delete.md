       captcha_id                       = "<captcha_ID>"
       advanced_rate_limiter_profile_id = "<ARL_profile_ID>"

       # Smart Protection rule
       security_rule {
         name     = "smart-protection"
         priority = 99999

         smart_protection {
           mode = "API"
         }
       }

       #Basic rule
       security_rule {
         name = "base-rule-geo"
         priority = 100000
         rule_condition {
           action = "ALLOW"
           condition {
             source_ip {
               geo_ip_match {
                 locations = ["ru", "kz"]

         }
       }

       # WAF profile rule
       security_rule {
         name     = "waf"
         priority = 88888

         waf {
           mode           = "API"
           waf_profile_id = "<WAF_profile_ID>"
