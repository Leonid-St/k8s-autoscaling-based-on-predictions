# Monitoring processes in queues

You can monitor the handling processes for messages in queues using monitoring tools in the management console. These tools display diagnostic information as charts.

To view this information:

{% list tabs group=instructions %}

- Management console {#console}

   1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), select the folder the message queue belongs to.
   1. Select **{{ ui-key.yacloud.iam.folder.dashboard.label_message-queue }}**.
   1. In the left-hand panel, select ![image](../../_assets/console-icons/display-pulse.svg) **{{ ui-key.yacloud.common.monitoring }}**.

   Sections with charts appear on the page.

## Sending messages {#send}

**Sent messages stats** contains charts with information about sending messages:

* **Sent messages, count**: Number of messages sent to the queue per unit of time.

* **Sent messages, size**: The total size of messages sent to the queue per unit of time (in bytes).

* **SendMessage duration**: The time it takes to execute a [SendMessage](../api-ref/message/SendMessage.md) request.

   {% include [ymq-monitoring-query-duration.md](../../_includes/message-queue/ymq-monitoring-query-duration.md) %}

* **SendMessageBatch duration**: The time it takes to execute a [SendMessageBatch](../api-ref/message/SendMessageBatch.md) request.

   {% include [ymq-monitoring-query-duration.md](../../_includes/message-queue/ymq-monitoring-query-duration.md) %}

* **SendMessage errors**: Number of errors when executing the `SendMessage` and `SendMessageBatch` requests.

## Receiving messages {#receive}

**Received messages & processing stats** contains charts with information about receiving and processing messages:

* **Received messages, size**: The total size of messages received from the queue per unit of time (in bytes).

* **Received messages, count**: Number of messages received from the queue per unit of time.

* **Messages in flight, count**: Number of messages received by recipients but not deleted from the queue (that are still within the [visibility timeout](../concepts/visibility-timeout.md) window).

* **ReceiveMessages requests**: Total number of [ReceiveMessage](../api-ref/message/ReceiveMessage) requests and number of requests with empty responses.

   An empty response to a request indicates that there were no messages available for reading within the specified waiting time (the `WaitTimeSeconds` attribute).

* **ReceiveMessages duration**: The time it takes to execute a `ReceiveMessage` request.

   {% include [ymq-monitoring-query-duration.md](../../_includes/message-queue/ymq-monitoring-query-duration.md) %}

* **ReceiveMessage errors**: Number of errors when executing the `ReceiveMessage` requests.

* **Message processing on client duration**: Message processing time spent by the recipient.

   {% include [ymq-monitoring-message-duration.md](../../_includes/message-queue/ymq-monitoring-message-duration.md) %}

* **Receive attempts per message, count**: Number of registered attempts to receive a message.

   The value increases if a message was received by the recipient but returned to the queue after the [visibility timeout](../concepts/visibility-timeout.md) expired. The lines on the chart correspond to the number of receive attempts:

    * 0-1
    * 2
    * 3-5
    * More than 5

## Deleting messages {#delete}

**Delete messages stats** contains charts with information about deleting messages:

* **Deleted messages, count**: Number of messages deleted from the queue in a unit of time using the [DeleteMessage](../api-ref/message/DeleteMessage) or [DeleteMessageBatch](../api-ref/message/DeleteMessageBatch) method.
* **DeleteMessage duration**: Time it takes to execute a `DeleteMessage` request.

   {% include [ymq-monitoring-query-duration.md](../../_includes/message-queue/ymq-monitoring-query-duration.md) %}

* **DeleteMessageBatch duration**: The time it takes to execute a `DeleteMessageBatch` request.

   {% include [ymq-monitoring-query-duration.md](../../_includes/message-queue/ymq-monitoring-query-duration.md) %}

* **DeleteMessage errors**: Number of errors when executing the `DeleteMessage` and `DeleteMessageBatch` requests.

* **Purged messages, count**: Number of messages purged from the queue in a unit of time using the [PurgeQueue](../api-ref/queue/PurgeQueue) method.

## Overall queue metrics {#queue}

**Overall queue stats** contains charts with general information about processes in queues:

* **Messages in queue, count** (metric name: `queue.messages.stored_count`): Number of messages currently enqueued. Measured in `pcs`, number of.

* **Age of oldest message in queue** (metric name: `queue.messages.oldest_age_milliseconds`): Retention time of the oldest message in the queue. The metric name is obsolete and its `milliseconds` part does not reflect the current units of measure. Currently, the metric is measured in seconds (`s`).

* **Message reside duration** (metric names: `p99` for the 99th percentile, `p95` for the 95th percentile, `p90` for the 90th percentile, `p50` for the 50th percentile): Enqueued message processing time in milliseconds (`ms`).
