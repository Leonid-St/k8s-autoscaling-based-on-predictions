# Certificate Manager Private CA API, gRPC: PrivateCaService.SendSignedCertificateOfCertificateAuthority

Sends a signed certificate chain after a CSR has been generated.
This finalizes the creation process after a signed certificate has been obtained.

## gRPC request

**rpc SendSignedCertificateOfCertificateAuthority ([SendSignedCertificateOfCertificateAuthorityRequest](#yandex.cloud.certificatemanager.v1.privateca.SendSignedCertificateOfCertificateAuthorityRequest)) returns ([operation.Operation](#yandex.cloud.operation.Operation))**

## SendSignedCertificateOfCertificateAuthorityRequest {#yandex.cloud.certificatemanager.v1.privateca.SendSignedCertificateOfCertificateAuthorityRequest}

```json
{
  "certificate_authority_id": "string",
  "pem_content": "string"
}
```

Request for sending a signed certificate for an existing Certificate Authority.
This is used to send back the signed certificate that will finalize the creation of the CA.

#|
||Field | Description ||
|| certificate_authority_id | **string**

Required field. The ID of the created but not activated Certificate Authority. ||
|| pem_content | **string**

Required field. The PEM-encoded content of the signed certificate.
This signed certificate is derived externally from the CSR and needs to complete the CA creation. ||

An Operation resource. For more information, see [Operation](/docs/api-design-guide/concepts/operation).

#|
||Field | Description ||
|| id | **string**

ID of the operation. ||
|| description | **string**

Description of the operation. 0-256 characters long. ||
|| created_at | **[google.protobuf.Timestamp](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#timestamp)**

Creation timestamp. ||
|| created_by | **string**

ID of the user or service account who initiated the operation. ||
|| modified_at | **[google.protobuf.Timestamp](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#timestamp)**

The time when the Operation resource was last modified. ||
|| done | **bool**

If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress.
If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available. ||
|| metadata | **[SendSignedCertificateOfCertificateAuthorityMetadata](#yandex.cloud.certificatemanager.v1.privateca.SendSignedCertificateOfCertificateAuthorityMetadata)**

Service-specific metadata associated with the operation.
It typically contains the ID of the target resource that the operation is performed on.
Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any. ||
|| error | **[google.rpc.Status](https://cloud.google.com/tasks/docs/reference/rpc/google.rpc#status)**

The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.

Includes only one of the fields `error`, `response`.

The operation result.
If `done == false` and there was no failure detected, neither `error` nor `response` is set.
If `done == false` and there was a failure detected, `error` is set.
If `done == true`, exactly one of `error` or `response` is set. ||
|| response | **[CertificateAuthority](#yandex.cloud.certificatemanager.v1.privateca.CertificateAuthority)**

The normal response of the operation in case of success.
If the original method returns no data on success, such as Delete,
the response is [google.protobuf.Empty](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#google.protobuf.Empty).
If the original method is the standard Create/Update,
the response should be the target resource of the operation.
Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the response type, if any.

Includes only one of the fields `error`, `response`.

The operation result.
If `done == false` and there was no failure detected, neither `error` nor `response` is set.
If `done == false` and there was a failure detected, `error` is set.
